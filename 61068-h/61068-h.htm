<h2 id="TIGER-LILY">TIGER-LILY.</h2></div>


<p>The shrill treble of a girl's voice, raised to its
highest pitch in anger and remonstrance, broke in
upon the scholarly meditations of the teacher of the
Ridgemont grammar school. He raised his head
from his book to listen. It came again, mingled
with boyish cries and jeers, and the sound of blows
and scuffling. The teacher, a small, fagged-looking
man of middle age, rose hastily, and went out
of the school-house.</p>

<p>Both grammar and high school had just been
dismissed, and the bare-trodden play-ground was
filled with the departing scholars. In the centre
of the ground a group of boys had collected, and
from this group the discordant sounds still proceeded.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this disturbance?" the
master asked, coming near.</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the group fell apart,
disclosing, as a central point, the figure of a girl
of thirteen or fourteen years. She was thin and
straight, and her face, now ablaze with anger and
excitement, was a singular one, full of contradic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>tions,
yet not inharmonious as a whole. It was
fair, but not as blondes are fair, and its creamy
surface was flecked upon the cheeks with dark, velvety
freckles. Her features were symmetrical, yet
a trifle heavy, particularly the lips, and certain
dusky tints were noticeable about the large gray
eyes and delicate temples, as well as a peculiar
crisp ripple in the mass of vivid red hair which fell
from under her torn straw hat.</p>

<p>Clinging to her scant skirts was a small hunch-backed
boy, crying dismally, and making the most
of his tears by rubbing them into his sickly face
with a pair of grimy fists.</p>

<p>The teacher looked about him with disapproval
in his glance. The group contained, no doubt, its
fair proportion of future legislators and presidents,
but the raw material was neither encouraging nor
pleasant to look upon. The culprits returned his
wavering gaze, some looking a little conscience-smitten,
others boldly impertinent, others still (and
those the worst in the lot) with a charming air of
innocence and candor.</p>

<p>"What is it?" the master repeated. "What is
the matter?"</p>

<p>"They were plaguing Bobby, here," the girl
broke in, breathlessly,&mdash;"taking his marbles away,
and making him cry&mdash;the mean, cruel things!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the teacher, with a feeble gesture
of authority. "Is that so, boys?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys grinned at each other furtively, but
made no answer.</p>

<p>"Boys," he remarked, solemnly, "I&mdash;I'm
ashamed of you!"</p>

<p>The delinquents not appearing crushed by this
announcement, he turned again to the girl.</p>

<p>"Girls should not quarrel and fight, my dear.
It isn't proper, you know."</p>

<p>A mocking smile sprang to the girl's lips, and a
sharp glance shot from under her black, up-curling
lashes, but she did not speak.</p>

<p>"She's allers a-fightin'," ventured one of the
urchins, emboldened by the teacher's reproof; at
which the girl turned upon him so fiercely that he
shrank hastily out of sight behind his nearest companion.</p>

<p>"You are not one of <i>my</i> scholars?" the master
asked, keeping his mild eyes upon the scornful face
and defiant little figure.</p>

<p>"No!" the girl answered. "I go to the high
school!"</p>

<p>"You are small to be in the high school," he
said, smiling upon her kindly.</p>

<p>"It don't go by sizes!" said the child promptly.</p>

<p>"No; certainly not, certainly not," said the
teacher, a little staggered. "What is your name,
child?"</p>

<p>"Lilly, sir; Lilly O'Connell," she answered, indifferently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lilly!" the teacher repeated abstractedly,
looking into the dusky face, with its flashing eyes
and fallen ruddy tresses,&mdash;"Lilly!"</p>

<p>"It <i>ought</i> to have been <i>Tiger</i>-Lily!" said a
pert voice. "It would suit her, I'm sure, more
ways than one!" and the speaker, a pretty, handsomely-dressed
blonde girl of about her own age,
laughed, and looked about for appreciation of her
cleverness.</p>

<p>"So it would!" cried a boyish voice. "Her
red hair, and freckles, and temper! Tiger-Lily!
That's a good one!"</p>

<p>A shout of laughter, and loud cries of "Tiger-Lily!"
immediately arose, mingled with another
epithet more galling still, in the midst of which the
master's deprecating words were utterly lost.</p>

<p>A dark red surged into the girl's face. She
turned one eloquent look of wrath upon her tormentors,
another, intensified, upon the pretty child
who had spoken, and walked away from the place,
leading the cripple by the hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Flossie," said a handsome boy,
who stood near the blonde girl, "I wouldn't tease
her. <i>She</i> can't help it, you know."</p>

<p>"Pity she couldn't know who is taking up for
her!" she retorted, tossing the yellow braid which
hung below her waist, and sauntering away homeward.</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" the boy said, coloring to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
roots of his hair; "that's the way with you girls.
You know what I mean. She can't help it that
her mother was a&mdash;a mulatto, or something, and
her hair red. It's mean to tease her."</p>

<p>"She can help quarrelling and fighting with the
boys, though," said Miss Flossie, looking unutterable
scorn.</p>

<p>"She wouldn't do it, I guess, if they'd let her
alone," the young fellow answered, stoutly. "It's
enough to make anybody feel savage to be badgered,
and called names, and laughed at all the time.
It makes me mad to see it. Besides, it isn't always
for herself she quarrels. It's often enough
for some little fellow like Bobby, that the big
fellows are abusing. She is good-hearted, anyhow."</p>

<p>They had reached by this time the gate opening
upon the lawn which surrounded the residence of
Flossie's mother, the widow Fairfield. It was a
small, but ornate dwelling, expressive, at every
point, of gentility and modern improvements. The
lawn itself was well kept, and adorned with flower-beds
and a tiny fountain. Mrs. Fairfield, a
youthful matron in rich mourning of the second
stage, sat in a wicker chair upon the veranda
reading, and fanning herself with an air of elegant
leisure.</p>

<p>Miss Flossie paused. She did not want to quarrel
with her boyish admirer, and, with the true in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>stinct
of coquetry, instantly appeared to have forgotten
her previous irritation.</p>

<p>"Won't you come in, Roger?" she said, sweetly.
"Our strawberries are ripe."</p>

<p>The boy smiled at the tempting suggestion, but
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Can't," he answered, briefly. "I've got a lot
of Latin to do. Good-by."</p>

<p>He nodded pleasantly and went his way. It
lay through the village and along the fields and
gardens beyond. Just as he came in sight of
his home,&mdash;a square, elm-shaded mansion of
red brick, standing on a gentle rise a little farther
on,&mdash;he paused at a place where a shallow
brook came creeping through the lush grass of
the meadow which bounded his father's possessions.
He listened a moment to its low gurgling,
so suggestive of wood rambles and speckled
trout, then tossed his strap of books into the
meadow, leaped after it, and followed the brook's
course for a little distance, stooping and peering
with his keen brown eyes into each dusky
pool.</p>

<p>All at once, as he looked and listened, another
sound than the brook's plashing came to his ears,
and he started up and turned his head. A stump
fence, black and bristling, divided the meadow
from the adjoining field, its uncouth projections
draped in tender, clinging vines, and he stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
softly toward it and looked across. It was a rocky
field, where a thin crop of grass was trying to hold
its own against a vast growth of weeds, and was
getting the worst of it,&mdash;a barren, shiftless field,
fitly matching the big shiftless barn and small
shiftless house to which it appertained.</p>

<p>Lying prone among the daisies was Lilly O'Connell,
her face buried in her apron, the red rippling
mane falling about her, her slender form shaking
with deep and unrestrained sobs.</p>

<p>Roger looked on a moment and then leaped the
fence. The girl rose instantly to a sitting position,
and glared defiance at him from a pair of tear-stained
eyes.</p>

<p>"What are you crying about?" he asked, with
awkward kindness.</p>

<p>Her face softened, and a fresh sob shook her.</p>

<p>"Oh, come!" said Roger; "don't mind what
a lot of sneaks say."</p>

<p>The girl looked up quickly into the honest dark
eyes.</p>

<p>"It was Florence Fairfield that said it," she returned,
speaking very rapidly.</p>

<p>Roger gave an uneasy laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh! you mean that about the 'Tiger-Lily'?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, "and it's true. It's true
as can be. See!" And for the first time the boy
noticed that her gingham apron was filled with the
fiery blossoms of the tiger-lily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"See!" she said again, with an unchildish laugh,
holding the flowers against her face.</p>

<p>Roger was not an imaginative boy, but he could
not help feeling the subtle likeness between the
fervid blossoms, strange, tropical outgrowth of
arid New England soil, and this passionate child
of mingled races, with her ruddy hair, and glowing
eyes and lips. For a moment he did not know
what to say, but at last, in his simple, boyish way
he said:</p>

<p>"Well, what of it? I think they're splendid."</p>

<p>The girl looked up incredulously.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind the&mdash;the <i>hair</i>!" he stammered.
"I've got a cousin up to Boston, and
she's a great belle&mdash;a beauty, you know. All the
artists are crazy to paint her picture, and her hair
is just the color of yours."</p>

<p>Lilly laid the flowers down. Her eyes fell.</p>

<p>"You don't understand," she said, slowly.
"Other girls have red hair. It isn't that."</p>

<p>Roger's eyes faltered in their reassuring gaze.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wouldn't mind&mdash;the <i>other</i> thing, either,
if I were you," he stammered.</p>

<p>"You don't know <i>what</i> you'd do if you were
<i>me</i>!" the girl cried, passionately. "You don't
know <i>what</i> you'd do if you were hated, and despised,
and laughed at, every day of your life!
And how would you like the feeling that it could
never be any different, no matter where you went,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
or how hard you tried to be good, or how much
you learned? Never, <i>never</i> any different! Ah, it
makes me hate myself, and everybody! I could
tear them to pieces, like this, and this!"</p>

<p>She had risen, and was tearing the scarlet petals
of the lilies into pieces, her teeth set, her eyes
flashing.</p>

<p>"Look at them!" she cried wildly. "How
like me they are, all red blood like yours, except
those few black drops which never can be washed
out! Never! <i>Never!</i>"</p>

<p>And again the child threw herself upon the
ground, face downward, and broke into wild, convulsive
sobbing.</p>

<p>Young Roger was in an agony of pity. He
found his position as consoler a trying one. An
older person might well have quailed before this
outburst of unchild-like passion. He knew that
what she said was true&mdash;terribly, bitterly true, and
this kept him dumb. He only stood and looked
down upon the quivering little figure in embarrassed
silence.</p>

<p>Suddenly the girl raised her head, with a flash
of her eyes.</p>

<p>"What does God mean," she cried, fiercely,
"by making such a difference in people?"</p>

<p>Roger's face became graver still.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you that, Lilly," he answered, soberly.
"You'll have to ask the minister. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
I've often thought of it myself. I suppose there <i>is</i>
a reason, if we only knew. I guess all we can do
is to begin where God has put us, and do what we
can."</p>

<p>Lilly slowly gathered her disordered hair into
one hand and pushed it behind her shoulders, her
tear-stained eyes fixed sadly on the boy's troubled
face.</p>

<p>The tea-bell, sounding from the distance, brought
a welcome interruption, and Roger turned to go.
He looked back when half across the meadow, and
saw the little figure standing in relief upon a rocky
hillock, the sun kindling her red locks into gold.</p>

<p>A few years previously, O'Connell had made his
appearance in Ridgemont with wife and child, and
had procured a lease of the run-down farm and
buildings which had been their home ever since.
It was understood that they had come from one of
the Middle States, but beyond this nothing of their
history was known.</p>

<p>The wife, a beautiful quadroon, sank beneath the
severity of the climate, and lived but a short time.
After her death, O'Connell, always a surly, hot-headed
fellow, grew surlier still, and fell into evil
ways. The child, with a curious sort of dignity
and independence, took upon her small shoulders
the burden her mother had laid aside, and carried
on the forlorn household in her own way, without
assistance or interference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>That she was not like other children, that she
was set apart from them by some strange circumstance,
she had early learned to feel. In time she
began to comprehend in what the difference lay,
and the knowledge roused within her a burning
sense of wrong, a fierce spirit of resistance.</p>

<p>With the creamy skin, the full, soft features, the
mellow voice, and impassioned nature of her quadroon
mother, Lilly had inherited the fiery Celtic
hair, gray-green eyes, and quick intelligence of her
father.</p>

<p>She contrived to go to school, where her cleverness
placed her ahead of other girls of her age, but
did not raise her above the unreasoning aversion
of her school-mates; and the consciousness of this
rankled in the child's soul, giving to her face a
pathetic, hunted look, and to her tongue a sharpness
which few cared to encounter.</p>

<p>Those who knew her best&mdash;her teachers, and a
few who would not let their inborn and unconquerable
prejudice of race stand in the way of their
judgment&mdash;knew that, with all her faults of temper,
the girl was brave, and truthful, and warm-hearted.
They pitied the child, born under a shadow which
could never be lifted, and gave her freely the kind
words for which her heart secretly longed.</p>

<p>There was little else they could do, for every attempt
at other kindness was repelled with a proud
indifference which forbade further overtures. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
she had gone her way, walking in the shadow
which darkened and deepened as she grew older,
until at last she stood upon the threshold of womanhood.</p>

<p>It was at this period of her life that the incidents
we have related occurred. Small as they were,
they proved a crisis in the girl's life. Too much a
child to be capable of forming a definite resolve, or
rather, perhaps, of putting it into form and deliberately
setting about its fulfilment, still the sensitive
nature had received an impression, which became a
most puissant influence in shaping her life.</p>

<p>A change came over her, so great as to have escaped
no interested eyes; but interested eyes
were few.</p>

<p>Her teachers, more than any others, marked the
change. There was more care of her person and
dress, and the raillery of her school-mates was met
by an indifference which, however hard its assumption
may have been, at once disarmed and puzzled
them.</p>

<p>Now and then, the low and unprovoked taunts of
her boyish tormentors roused her to an outburst
of the old spirit, but for the most part they were
met only with a flash of the steel-gray eyes, and a
curl of the full red lips.</p>

<p>One Sunday, too, to the amazement of pupils
and the embarrassment of teachers, Lilly O'Connell,
neatly attired and quite self-possessed, walked into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the Sunday-school, from which she had angrily departed,
stung by some childish slight, two years
before. The minister went to her, welcomed her
pleasantly, and gave her a seat in a class of girls of
her own age, who, awed by the mingled dignity
and determination of his manner, swallowed their
indignation, and moved along&mdash;a trifle more than
was necessary&mdash;to give her room.</p>

<p>The little tremor of excitement soon subsided,
and Lilly's quickness and attentiveness won for her
an outward show, at least, of consideration and
kindness, which extended outside of school limits,
and gradually, all demonstrations of an unpleasant
nature ceased.</p>

<p>When she was about sixteen her father died.
This event, which left her a homeless orphan, was
turned by the practical kindness of Parson Townsend&mdash;the
good old minister who had stood between
her and a thousand annoyances and wrongs&mdash;into
the most fortunate event of her life. He,
not without some previous domestic controversy,
took the girl into his own family, and there, under
kind and Christian influences, she lived for a number
of years.</p>

<p>At eighteen her school-life terminated, and, by
the advice of Parson Townsend, she applied for
a position as teacher of the primary school.</p>

<p>The spirit with which her application was met
was a revelation and a shock to her. The outward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
kindness and tolerance which of late years had been
manifested toward her, had led her into a fictitious
state of content and confidence.</p>

<p>"I was foolish enough," she said to herself,
with bitterness, "to think that because the boys
do not hoot after me in the street, people had forgotten,
or did not care."</p>

<p>The feeling of ostracism stung, but could not degrade,
a nature like hers. She withdrew more and
more into herself, turned her hands to such work
as she could find to do, and went her way again,
stifling as best she might the anguished cry which
sometimes would rise to her lips:</p>

<p>"What does God mean by it?"</p>

<p>Few saw the beauty of those deep, clear eyes
and pathetic lips, or the splendor of her burnished
hair, or the fine curves of her tall, upright figure.
She was only odd, and "queer looking"&mdash;only
Lilly O'Connell; very pleasant of speech, and
quick at her needle, and useful at picnics and
church fairs, and in case of sickness or emergencies
of any kind,&mdash;but Lilly O'Connell still,&mdash;or "Tiger-Lily,"
for the old name had never been altogether
laid aside.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ten years passed by. The good people of
Ridgemont were fond of alluding to the remarkable
progress and development made by their picturesque
little town during the past decade, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
reality the change was not so great. A few new
dwellings, built in the modern efflorescent style,
had sprung up, to the discomfiture of the prim,
square houses, with dingy white paint and dingier
green blinds, which belonged to another epoch; a
brick block, of almost metropolitan splendor, cast
its shadow across the crooked village street, and a
soldiers' monument, an object of special pride and
reverence, adorned the centre of the small common,
opposite the Hide and Leather Bank and the
post-office.</p>

<p>Beside these, a circulating library, a teacher of
china-painting and a colored barber were casually
mentioned to strangers, as proofs of the slightness
of difference in the importance of Ridgemont and
some other towns of much more pretension.</p>

<p>Over the old Horton homestead hardly a shadow
of change had passed. It presented the same appearance
of prosperous middle age. The great
elms about it looked not a day older; the hydrangeas
on the door-step flowered as exuberantly;
the old-fashioned roses bloomed as red, and white,
and yellow, against the mossy brick walls; the
flower-plots were as trim, and the rustic baskets
of moneywort flourished as green, as in the days
when Mrs. Horton walked among them, and
tended them with her own hands. She had lain
with her busy hands folded these five years, in
the shadow of the Horton monument, between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
grave of Dr. Jared Horton and a row of lessening
mounds which had been filled many, many years&mdash;the
graves of the children who were born&mdash;and had
died&mdash;before Roger's birth.</p>

<p>A great quiet had hung about the place for
several years. The blinds upon the front side had
seldom been seen to open, except for weekly airings
or semi-annual cleanings.</p>

<p>But one day in mid-summer the parlor windows
are seen wide open, the front door swung back,
and several trunks, covered with labels of all colors,
and in several languages, are standing in the
large hall.</p>

<p>An unwonted stir about the kitchen and stable,
a lively rattling of silver and china in the dining room,
attest to some unusual cause for excitement.
The cause is at once manifest as the door at the
end of the hall opens, and Roger Horton appears,
against a background composed of mahogany side-board
and the erect and vigilant figure of Nancy
Swift, the faithful old housekeeper of his mother's
time.</p>

<p>The handsome, manly lad had fulfilled the
promise of his boyhood. He was tall and full-chested;
a trifle thin, perhaps, and his fine face,
now bronzed with travel, grave and thoughtful for
his years, but capable of breaking into a smile like
a sudden transition from a minor to a major key in
music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked more than thoughtful at this moment.
He had hardly tasted the food prepared by Nancy
with a keen eye to his youthful predilections, and
in the firm conviction that he must have suffered
terrible deprivations during his foreign travels.</p>

<p>Truly, this coming home was not like the comings-home
of other days, when two dear faces, one
gray-bearded and genial, the other pale and gentle-eyed,
had smiled upon him across the comfortable
board. The sense of loss was almost more than he
could bear; the sound of his own footsteps in the
cool, empty hall smote heavily upon his heart.</p>

<p>The door of the parlor stood ajar, and he pushed
it open and stepped into the room. Everything
was as it had always been ever since he could remember&mdash;furniture,
carpets, curtains, everything.
Just opposite the door hung the portraits of his
parents, invested by the dim half-light with a life-like
air which the unknown artist had vainly tried
to impart.</p>

<p>Roger had not entered the room since his
mother's funeral, which followed close upon that of
his father, and just before the close of his collegiate
course.</p>

<p>Something in the room brought those scenes of
bitter grief too vividly before him. It might have
been the closeness of the air, or, more probably,
the odor rising from a basket of flowers which
stood upon the centre-table. He remembered now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
that Nancy had mentioned its arrival while he was
going through the ceremony of taking tea, and he
went up to the table and bent over it. Upon a
snowy oval of choicest flowers, surrounded by a
scarlet border, the word "Welcome" was wrought
in purple violets.</p>

<p>The young man smiled as he read the name
upon the card attached. He took up one of the
white carnations and began fastening it to the lapel
of his coat, but put it back at length, and with
a glance at the painted faces, whose eyes seemed
following his every motion, he took his hat and
went out of the house.</p>

<p>His progress through the streets of his native
village took the form of an ovation. Nearly every
one he met was an old acquaintance or friend. It
warmed his heart, and took away the sting of loneliness
which he had felt before, to see how cordial
were the greetings. Strong, manly grips, kind,
womanly hand-pressures, and shy, blushing greetings
from full-fledged village beauties, whom he
vaguely remembered as lank, sun-burned little
girls, met him at every step.</p>

<p>He noticed, and was duly impressed by, the ornate
new dwellings, the soldiers' monument, and
the tonsorial establishment of Professor Commeraw.
But beyond these boasted improvements, it
might have been yesterday, instead of four years
ago, that he passed along the same street on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
way to the station. Even Deacon White's sorrel
mare was hitched before the leading grocery-store
in precisely the same spot, and blinking dejectedly
at precisely the same post, he could have taken his
oath, where she had stood and blinked on that
morning.</p>

<p>Before the tumble-down structure where, in connection
with the sale of petrified candy, withered
oranges, fly-specked literature, and gingerpop,
the post-office was carried on, sat that genial old
reprobate, the post-master, relating for the hundredth
time to a sleepy and indifferent audience,
his personal exploits in the late war; pausing,
however, long enough to bestow upon Horton a
greeting worthy of the occasion.</p>

<p>"Welcome home!" said Mr. Doolittle, with an
oratorical flourish, as became a politician and a
post-master; "welcome back to the land of the
free and the home of the brave!"</p>

<p>Whereupon he carefully seated himself on the
precarious chair which served him as rostrum, and
resumed his gory narrative.</p>

<p>A little further on, another village worthy, Fred
Hanniford, cobbler, vocalist, and wit, sat pegging
away in the door of his shop, making the welkin
ring with the inspiring strains of "The Sword of
Bunker Hill," just as in the old days. True, the
brilliancy of his tones was somewhat marred by the
presence of an ounce or so of shoe-pegs in his left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
cheek, but this fact had no dampening effect upon
the enthusiasm of a select, peanut-consuming audience
of small boys on the steps.</p>

<p>He, too, suspended work and song to nod
familiarly to his somewhat foreignized young
townsman, and watched him turn the corner, fixing
curious and jealous eyes upon the receding
feet.</p>

<p>"Who made your boots?" he remarked <i>sotto
voce</i>, as their firm rap upon the plank sidewalk grew
indistinct, which profound sarcasm having extracted
the expected meed of laughter from his juvenile
audience, Mr. Hanniford resumed his hammer, and
burst forth with a high G of astounding volume.</p>

<p>As young Horton came in sight of Mrs. Fairfield's
residence, he involuntarily quickened his steps. As
a matter of course, he had met in his wanderings
many pretty and agreeable girls, and, being an attractive
young man, it is safe to say that eyes of
every hue had looked upon him with more or less
favor. It would be imprudent to venture the assertion
that the young man had remained quite indifferent
to all this, but Horton's nature was more
tender than passionate; early associations held him
very closely, and his boyish fancy for the widow's
pretty daughter had never quite faded. A rather
fitful correspondence had been kept up, and photographs
exchanged, and he felt himself justified
in believing that the welcome the purple violets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
had spoken would speak to him still more eloquently
from a pair of violet eyes.</p>

<p>He scanned the pretty lawn with a pleased, expectant
glance. Flowers were massed in red, white
and purple against the vivid green; the fountain
was scattering its spray; hammocks were slung in
tempting nooks, and fanciful wicker chairs, interwoven
with blue and scarlet ribbons, stood about the
vine-draped piazza. He half expected a girlish figure
to run down the walk to meet him, in the old
childish way, and as a fold of white muslin swept
out of the open window his heart leaped; but it
was only the curtain after all, and just as he saw
this with a little pang of disappointment, a girl's
figure did appear, and came down the walk toward
him. It was a tall figure, in a simple dark
dress. As it came nearer, he saw a colorless,
oval face, with downcast eyes, and a mass of ruddy
hair, burnished like gold, gathered in a coil under
the small black hat. There was something proud,
yet shrinking, in the face and in the carriage of the
whole figure. As the latch fell from his hand the
girl looked up, and encountered his eyes, pleased,
friendly and a trifle astonished, fixed full upon her.</p>

<p>She stopped, and a beautiful color swept into her
cheeks, a sudden unleaping flame filled the luminous
eyes, and her lips parted.</p>

<p>"Why, it is Lilly O'Connell!" the young man
said, cordially, extending his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl's hand was half extended to meet his,
but with a quick glance toward the house she drew
it back into the folds of her black dress, bowing
instead.</p>

<p>Horton let his hand fall, a little flush showing
itself upon his forehead.</p>

<p>"Are you not going to speak to me, Miss O'Connell?"
he said, in his frank, pleasant way. "Are
you not going to say you are glad to see me back,
like all the rest?"</p>

<p>The color had all faded from the girl's cheeks and
neck. She returned his smiling glance with an
earnest look, hesitating before she spoke.</p>

<p>"I am very glad, Mr. Horton," she said, at last,
and, passing him, went swiftly out of sight.</p>

<p>The young man stood a moment with his hand
upon the gate, looking after her; then turned and
went up the walk to the door, and rang the bell.
A smiling maid admitted him, and showed him
into a very pretty drawing-room.</p>

<p>He had not waited long when Florence, preceded
by her mother, came in. She had been a pretty
school-girl, but he was hardly prepared to see so
beautiful a young woman, or one so self-possessed,
and so free from provincialism in dress and manner.
She was a blonde beauty, of the delicate, porcelain-tinted
type, small, but so well-made and well-dressed
as to appear much taller than she really
was. She was lovely to-night in a filmy white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
dress, so richly trimmed with lace as to leave the
delicate flesh-tints of shoulders and arms visible
through the fine meshes.</p>

<p>She had always cared for Roger, and, being full
of delight at his return and his distinguished appearance,
let her delight appear undisguisedly.
Although a good deal of a coquette, with Roger
coquetry seemed out of place. His own simple,
sincere manners were contagious, and Florence had
never been more charming.</p>

<p>"Tell us all about the pictures and artists and
singers you have seen and heard," she said, in the
course of their lively interchange of experiences.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I can talk better about hospitals and
surgeons," said Horton. "You know I am not a bit
æsthetic, and I have been studying very closely."</p>

<p>"You are determined, then, to practise medicine?"
Mrs. Fairfield said, with rather more anxiety
in her tones than the occasion seemed to demand.</p>

<p>"I think I am better fitted for that profession
than any other," Horton answered.</p>

<p>"Y-yes," assented Mrs. Fairfield, doubtfully,
looking at her daughter.</p>

<p>"I should never choose it, if I were a man," said
Florence, decidedly.</p>

<p>"It seems to have chosen me," Horton said.
"I have not the slightest bent in any other direction."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is such a hard life," said Florence. "A
doctor must be a perfect hero."</p>

<p>"You used to be enthusiastic over heroes," said
Horton, smiling.</p>

<p>"I am now," said Florence, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not the kind who ride in buggies instead of
on foaming chargers and wield lancets instead of
lances," laughed Horton, looking into the slightly
vexed but lovely face opposite, with a great deal
of expression in his dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Of course you would not think of settling in
Ridgemont," remarked Mrs. Fairfield, blandly,
"after all you have studied."</p>

<p>"I don't see why not," he answered.</p>

<p>"But for an ambitious young man," began Mrs.
Fairfield.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am not an ambitious young man,"
said Horton. "There is a good opening here, and
the old home is very dear to me."</p>

<p>Florence was silently studying the toe of one
small sandalled foot.</p>

<p>"Well, to be sure," said Mrs. Fairfield, who
always endeavored to fill up pauses in conversation,&mdash;"to
be sure, Ridgemont <i>is</i> improving.
Don't you find it changed a good deal?"</p>

<p>"Why, not very much," Horton answered.
"Places don't change so much in a few years as
people. I met Lilly O'Connell as I came into your
grounds. <i>She</i> has changed&mdash;wonderfully."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Y-yes," said Mrs. Fairfield, rather stiffly. "She
<i>has</i> improved. Since her father died, she has lived
in Parson Townsend's family. She is a very respectable
girl, and an excellent seamstress."</p>

<p>Florence had gone to the window, and was looking
out.</p>

<p>"She was very good at her books, I remember,"
he went on. "I used to think she would make
something more than a seamstress."</p>

<p>"I only remember her dreadful temper," said
Florence, in a tone meant to sound careless. "We
called her 'Tiger-Lily,' you know."</p>

<p>"I never wondered at her temper," said Horton.
"She had a great deal to vex her. I suppose
things are not much better now."</p>

<p>"Oh, she is treated well enough," said Mrs.
Fairfield. "The best families in the place employ
her. I don't know what more she can expect, considering
that she is&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Off color," suggested Horton. "No. She cannot
expect much more. But it is terrible&mdash;isn't
it?&mdash;that stigma for no fault of hers. It must be
hard for a girl like her&mdash;like what she seems to
have become."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that," said Florence, going to the
piano and drumming lightly, without sitting down,
"she is very independent. She asserts herself
quite enough."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," broke in her mother, hastily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
"She actually had the impudence to apply for a
position as teacher of the primary school, and Parson
Townsend, and Hickson of the School Board,
were determined she should have it. The 'Gazette'
took it up, and for awhile Lilly was the heroine
of the day. But of course she did not succeed.
It would have ruined the school. A colored
teacher! Dreadful!"</p>

<p>"Dreadful, indeed," said Horton. He rose
and joined Florence at the piano, and a moment
later Mrs. Fairfield was contentedly drumming
upon the table, in the worst possible time, to her
daughter's performance of a brilliant waltz.</p>

<p>The evening terminated pleasantly. After Horton
had gone, mother and daughter had a long
confidential talk upon the piazza, which it is needless
to repeat. But at its close, as Mrs. Fairfield
was closing the doors for the night, she might have
been heard to say:</p>

<p>"You could spend your <i>winters</i> in Boston, you
know."</p>

<p>To which Florence returned a dreamy "Yes."</p>

<p>The tranquillity of Ridgemont was this summer
disturbed by several events of unusual local interest.
Two, of a melancholy nature, were the
deaths of good old Parson Townsend and of Dr.
Brown, one of the only two regular physicians of
whom the town could boast. The latter event
had the effect to bring about the beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
young Dr. Horton's professional career. The road
now lay fair and open before him. His father had
been widely known and liked, and people were
not slow in showing their allegiance to the honored
son of an honored father.</p>

<p>Of course this event, being one of common interest,
was duly discussed and commented upon,
and nowhere so loudly and freely as in the post-office
and cobbler's shop, where, surrounded by
their disciples and adherents, the respective proprietors
dispensed wit and wisdom in quantities suitable
to the occasion.</p>

<p>"He's young," remarked the worthy post-master,
with a wave of his clay pipe, "an' he's brought
home a lot o' new-fangled machines an' furrin
notions, but he's got a good stock of Yankee common-sense
to back it all, an' I opine he'll <i>do</i>."</p>

<p>And such was the general verdict.</p>

<p>His popularity was further increased by the rumor
of his engagement to Miss Florence Fairfield.
Miss Fairfield being a native of the town, and the
most elegant and accomplished young woman it
had so far produced, was regarded with much the
same feeling as the brick block and the soldiers'
monument; and as she drove through the village
streets in her pretty pony phaeton, she received a
great deal of homage in a quiet way, particularly
from the masculine portion of the community.</p>

<p>"A tip-top match for the young doctor," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
one. "She's putty as a picter an' smart as lightnin',
an' what's more, she's got 'the needful.'"</p>

<p>"Well, as to that," said another, "Horton ain't
no need to look for that. He's got property
enough."</p>

<p>To which must be added Mr. Hanniford's comments,
delivered amidst a rapid expectoration of
shoe-pegs.</p>

<p>"She's got the littlest foot of any girl in town,
an' I ought to know, for I made her shoes from the
time she was knee-high to a grasshopper till she
got sot on them French heels, which is a thing I ain't
agoin' to countenance. She was always very fond
o' my singin', too. Says she,'You'd ought to
have your voice cultivated, Mr. Hanniford,' says
she, 'it's equal, if not superior, to Waktel's or
Campyneeny's, any time o' day.' Though," he
added, musingly, "as to <i>cultivatin'</i>, I've been to
more'n eight or ten singin'-schools, an' I guess
there ain't much more to learn."</p>

<p>The death of Parson Townsend brought about
another crisis in the life of Lilly O'Connell. It had
been his express wish that she should remain an
inmate of his family, which consisted now of a
married son and his wife and children. But, with
her quick intuition, Lilly saw, before a week had
passed, that her presence was not desired by young
Mrs. Townsend, and her resolution was at once
taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Through all these years she had had one true
friend and helper&mdash;Priscilla Bullins, milliner and
dress-maker.</p>

<p>Miss Bullins was a queer little frizzed and ruffled
creature, with watery blue eyes, and a skin like
yellow crackle-ware. There was always a good
deal of rice-powder visible in her scant eyebrows,
and a frost-bitten bloom upon her cheeks which,
from its intermittent character, was sadly open to
suspicion, but a warm heart beat under the tight-laced
bodice, and it was to her, after some hours
of mental conflict, that Lilly went with her new
trouble. Miss Bullins listened with her soul in
arms.</p>

<p>"You'll come and stay with <i>me</i>; that's just
what you'll do, Lilly, and Jim Townsend's wife had
ought to be ashamed of herself, and she a professor!
I've got a nice little room you can have all to yourself.
It's next to mine, and you're welcome to it
till you can do better. I shall be glad of your
company, for, between you and me," dropping her
voice to a confidential whisper, "I ain't so young
as I was, and, bein' subject to spells in the night,
I ain't so fond of livin' alone as I used to be."</p>

<p>So Lilly moved her small possessions into Miss
Bullin's spare bedroom, and went to work in the
dingy back shop, rounding out her life with such
pleasure as could be found in a walk about the
burying-ground on Sundays, in the circulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
library, and in the weekly prayer-meeting, where
her mellow voice revelled in the sweet melodies of
the hymns, whose promises brought such comfort
to her lonely young heart.</p>

<p>From the window where she sat when at work
she could look out over fields and orchards, and
follow the winding of the river in and out the willow-fringed
banks. Just opposite the window, a
small island separated it into two deep channels,
which met at the lower point with a glad rush and
tumult, to flow on again united in a deeper,
smoother current than before.</p>

<p>Along the river bank, the road ran to the covered
bridge, and across it into the woods beyond.
And often, as Lilly sat at her work, she saw Miss
Fairfield's pony phaeton rolling leisurely along
under the overhanging willows, so near that the
voices of the occupants, for Miss Fairfield was
never alone, now, came up to her with the cool
river-breeze and the scent of the pines on the island.
Once, Roger Horton happened to look up,
and recognized her with one of those grave smiles
which always brought back her childhood and the
barren pasture where the tiger-lilies grew; and she
drew back into the shadow of the curtain again.</p>

<p>Doctor Horton saw Lilly O'Connell often; he
met her flitting through the twilight with bulky
parcels, at the bedsides of sick women and children,
and even at the various festivals which en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>livened
the tedium of the summer (where, indeed,
her place was among the workers only), and he
would have been glad to speak to her a friendly
word now and then, but she gave him little chance.
There was a look in her face which haunted him,
and the sound of her voice, rising fervid and mournful
above the others at church or conference-meeting,
thrilled him to the heart with its pathos.
Once, as he drove along the river-side after dark,
the voice came floating out from the unlighted window
of the shop where he so often saw her at work,
and it seemed to him like the note of the wood-thrush,
singing in the solitude of some deep forest.</p>

<p>Before the summer was over, something occurred
to heighten the interest which the sight of this solitary
maiden figure, moving so unheeded across
the dull background of village life, had inspired.</p>

<p>It was at a lawn party held upon Mrs. Fairfield's
grounds, for the benefit of the church of which she
was a prominent member. There was the usual
display of bunting, Chinese lanterns, decorated
booths, and pretty girls in white. A good many
people were present, and the Ridgemont brass
band was discoursing familiar strains. Doctor
Horton, dropping in, in the course of the evening,
gravitated naturally toward an imposing structure,
denominated on the bills the "Temple of Flora,"
where Miss Fairfield and attendant nymphs were
disposing of iced lemonade and button-hole bou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>quets
in the cause of religion. The place before
the booth was occupied by a group of young men,
who were flinging away small coin with that reckless
disregard of consequences peculiar to very
youthful men on such occasions. All were adorned
with <i>boutonnières</i> at every possible point, and were
laughing in a manner so exuberant as might, under
other circumstances, have led to the suspicion that
the beverage sold as lemonade contained something
of a more intoxicating nature.</p>

<p>Miss Fairfield was standing outside the booth,
one bare white arm extended across the green garlands
which covered the frame-work. She looked
bored and tired, and was gazing absently over the
shoulder of the delighted youth <i>vis-à-vis</i>.</p>

<p>Her face brightened as Doctor Horton was seen
making his way toward the place.</p>

<p>"We were laughing," said the young man who
had been talking with her, after greetings had been
exchanged,&mdash;"we were laughing over the latest
news. Heard it, Doctor?"</p>

<p>Dr. Horton signified his ignorance.</p>

<p>He was abstractedly studying the effect of a bunch
of red columbine nodding at a white throat just before
him. He had secured those flowers himself,
with some trouble, that very day, during a morning
drive, and he alone knew the sweetness of the
reward which had been his.</p>

<p>"A marriage, Doctor," went on the youth, jo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>cosely.
"Marriage in high life. Professor Samuel
Commeraw to Miss Lilly O'Connell, both of Ridgemont."</p>

<p>Horton looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"From whom did you get your information?"
he asked, coolly regarding the young fellow.</p>

<p>"From Commeraw himself," he answered, with
some hesitation.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Dr. Horton returned, indifferently. "I
thought it very likely."</p>

<p>"I don't find it so incredible," said Miss Fairfield,
in her fine, clear voice. "He is the only one
of her own color in the town. It seems to me very
natural."</p>

<p>Dr. Horton looked into the fair face. Was it
the flickering light of the Chinese lanterns which
gave the delicate features so hard and cold a look?</p>

<p>He turned his eyes away, and as he did so he
saw that Lilly O'Connell, with three or four children
clinging about her, had approached, and, impeded
by the crowd, had stopped very near the
floral temple. A glance at her face showed that
she had heard all which had been said concerning
her.</p>

<p>The old fiery spirit shone from her dilated eyes
as they swept over the insignificant face of the
youth who had spoken her name. Her lips were
contracted, and her hand, resting on the curly head
of one of the children, trembled violently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>She seemed about to speak, but as her eyes met
those of Doctor Horton, she turned suddenly, and,
forcing a passage through the crowd, disappeared.</p>

<p>Dr. Horton lingered about the flower-booth until
the increasing crowd compelled Miss Fairfield to
to resume her duties, when he slipped away, and
wandered aimlessly about the grounds. At last,
near the musicians' stand, he saw Lilly O'Connell
leaning against a tree, while the children whom
she had in charge devoured ice-cream and the
music with equal satisfaction. Her whole attitude
expressed weariness and dejection. Her face was
pale, her eyes downcast, her lips drawn like a
child's who longs to weep, yet dares not.</p>

<p>Not far away he saw, hanging upon the edge of
the crowd, the tall form of Commeraw, his eyes,
alert and swift of glance as those of a lynx, furtively
watching the girl, who seemed quite unconscious
of any one's observation.</p>

<p>Some one took Horton's attention for a moment,
and when he looked again both Lilly, with her
young charge, and Commeraw were no longer to
be seen. He moved away from the spot, vaguely
troubled and perplexed.</p>

<p>The brazen music clashed in his ears the strains
of "Sweet Bye-and-Bye," people persisted in talking
to him, and at last, in sheer desperation, he
turned his steps toward the temple of Flora. It
was almost deserted. The band had ceased play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>ing,
people were dispersing, the flowers had wilted,
and the pretty girls had dropped off one by one
with their respective cavaliers. The reigning goddess
herself was leaning against a green pillar, looking,
it must be confessed, a little dishevelled and a
good deal out of humor, but very lovely still.</p>

<p>"You must have found things very entertaining,"
she remarked, languidly. "You have been
gone an hour at least."</p>

<p>"I have been discussing sanitary drainage with
Dr. Starkey," Horton answered, taking advantage
of the wavering light to possess himself of one of
the goddess's warm white hands, and the explanation
was, in a measure, quite true.</p>

<p>Miss Fairfield made no other reply than to withdraw
her hand, under the pretext of gathering up
her muslin flounces for the walk across the lawn.
Horton drew her white wrap over the bare arms
and throat, and walked in silence by her side to
the hall door. Even then he did not speak at
once, feeling that the young lady was in no mood
for conversation, but at last he drew the little white
figure toward him, and said:</p>

<p>"You are tired, little girl. These church fairs
and festivals are a great nuisance. I will not come
in to-night, but I will drive round in the morning
to see how you have slept."</p>

<p>To his surprise, the girl turned upon him suddenly,
repulsing his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why," she began, hurriedly, "why are you
always defending Lilly O'Connell?"</p>

<p>She shot the question at him with a force which
took away his breath. She had always seemed to
him gentleness itself. He hardly recognized her,
as she faced him with white cheeks and blazing
eyes.</p>

<p>"It was always so," she went on, impetuously,
"ever since I can remember. You have always
been defending her. No one must speak of her as
if she were anything but a lady. I cannot understand
it, Roger! I want to know what it means&mdash;the
interest you show, and always have shown, in
that&mdash;that girl!"</p>

<p>Horton had recovered himself by this time. He
looked into the angry face with a quiet, almost
stern, gaze. The girl shrank a little before it, and
this, and the quiver of her voice toward the close
of her last sentence, softened the resentment which
had tingled through his veins. Shame, humiliation,
not for himself, but for her, his affianced wife,
burned on his cheeks.</p>

<p>"What interest, Florence?" he said, repeating
her words. "Just that interest which every honest
man, or woman, feels in a fellow-creature who
suffers wrongfully. Just that&mdash;and nothing more."</p>

<p>Her lips parted as if to retort, but the steadiness
of her lover's gaze disconcerted her. He was very
gentle, but she felt, as she had once or twice be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>fore,
the quiet mastery of his stronger nature, and
the eyes fell. He took both her hands and held
them awhile without removing his eyes from her
face.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Florence," he said, at last, almost
with sadness.</p>

<p>She would have liked to let him see that she
was sorry for her ill-temper, or rather for the manifestation
of it, but she was only overawed, not
penitent, and bent her head to his parting kiss
without a word.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two or three evenings later, Doctor Horton received
an urgent summons from one of his patients,
who lived at the end of a new and almost uninhabited
street. A lamp at the corner of the main
street lighted it for a short distance, beyond which
the darkness was intense. When just opposite the
lamp, and about to cross over, he observed a
woman pass swiftly across the lighted space in the
direction toward which he was himself going.
There was no mistaking the erect figure and graceful
gait&mdash;it was Lilly O'Connell. After an instant
of wondering what could have brought her there
at such an hour, for it was late, according to village
customs, he changed his intention as to crossing,
and kept down the other side.</p>

<p>The sight of this girl brought back afresh that
brief, unpleasant scene with Florence, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
had tried to forget, but which had recurred to him
very often, and always with a keen sting of pain
and shame. His faith in the woman he loved was
so perfect! Should hers be less in him? For
him there was no happiness without repose. To
doubt, to be doubted, would end all. He walked
on in the darkness, lost in such thoughts, and
quite forgetting where he was, but all at once he
became aware of other footsteps behind him, and
involuntarily looking back, he saw, just on the
edge of the lamp-lit space, the figure of a man&mdash;a
tall figure, with a certain panther-like grace of
movement. There was but one such in the town,
that of Commeraw, the mulatto.</p>

<p>The sight gave him a disagreeable shock. That
he was following Lilly O'Connell he had no doubt.
Could it be true, then, the rumor to which he had
given so little credence? He remembered, now,
that he had seen this fellow hanging about at various
times and places when she was present. Might it
not have been pretence&mdash;her proud indifference and
scornful evasion of his advances? He asked himself,
with a hot flush of mortification, the same
question which Florence had put to him. It was
true that he had many times openly defended her.
He had been forced to do so by that quality of his
nature which moved him always to espouse the
cause of the weak. Perhaps he had elevated this
girl to a higher plane than she deserved to occupy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
After all, it would not be strange if her heart, in
its longing for sympathy, had turned toward this
man of her dead mother's race. Then her face,
so sensitive, so overshadowed with sadness, came
before him, and he could not think of it in juxtaposition
with the brutal face of Commeraw. He
banished the thought with disgust.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the man could be seen creeping
along, a black shadow thrown into faint relief
against the white sand of the overhanging bank.
There was something furtive and stealthy in his
actions which excited Horton's fears. He saw
that he had at last overtaken the girl, and he
quickened his own pace until he was so near that
the sound of their voices came over to him.</p>

<p>"There is no other answer possible," she was
saying. "You must never speak to me in this
way again."</p>

<p>She would have gone on, but the man placed
himself before her. There was a deliberation in
the way he did so which showed his consciousness
of power.</p>

<p>"This is a lonesome place," he said, with a short,
cruel laugh.</p>

<p>She made no answer.</p>

<p>The man muttered an imprecation.</p>

<p>"You are not going to leave me so," he said.
"Curse it! why do you treat me so, as if I were a
dog? What are you more than I am? Are you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
so proud because you have a few more drops of
their cursed white blood in your veins than I have?
What will that help you? Do you imagine it will
get you a white husband?"</p>

<p>"Let me pass!" interrupted the girl, coldly.
"You can kill me if you like. I would rather die
than give you any other answer. Will you let me
pass?" and she made another swift motion to go
by him.</p>

<p>A savage cry came from his lips. He sprang
toward her. She made no outcry. The two
shadows struggled for a moment in deadly silence,
but it was only for a moment. Quick as thought,
Horton flung himself upon the man, who, taken
thus by surprise, loosened his hold upon the
girl, shook himself free, and, with a fierce oath,
fled.</p>

<p>Lilly staggered back against the bank.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid," said Horton, panting.
"The fellow will not come back."</p>

<p>"Doctor Horton!" she said, faintly.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is Doctor Horton. Where were you
going? I will see you in safety."</p>

<p>"I was on my way to watch with Mrs. Lapham,"
she answered, in firmer tones.</p>

<p>"I am going there too," said Horton. "If you
feel able, go on, I will follow after awhile. Or will
you go home?"</p>

<p>She came forward, walking a little slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will go on; she expects me."</p>

<p>And in a few moments she had disappeared
from sight.</p>

<p>Horton remained where she had left him for
perhaps a quarter of an hour. Then he proceeded
on his way. An old woman admitted him to the
house, and he went into the sick-room. Lilly
O'Connell was sitting by the cradle of the youngest
child, which lay across her lap. She greeted
him with a bow, and averted her head, but the
glimpse he had of her face showed him that it was
not only pale, but drawn as if with physical pain.</p>

<p>As he was about to leave his patient's side he
looked toward her again, and his eyes fell upon the
arm which supported the child's head. About
the sleeve, a handkerchief, stained with blood, was
tightly bound.</p>

<p>He went over to the corner where she was sitting.</p>

<p>"Will you come into the next room?" he said.
"I would like to give you some directions about
the medicine."</p>

<p>She gave him a quick, upward glance, arose,
laid the baby in the arms of the old woman, and
followed him mutely into the adjoining room,
where a light was burning on the table, and stood
before him, waiting for him to speak.</p>

<p>"You are hurt," he said, taking the bandaged
arm in his hand. "That fellow has wounded you."</p>

<p>"I suppose he meant to kill me," she answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
leaning with the disengaged arm against the
table.</p>

<p>Horton unbound the handkerchief. The blood
was oozing from a deep flesh cut below the elbow.
With skilful fingers, he ripped open the sleeve and
turned it back from the fair round arm. Then,
with the appliances the country doctor has always
at hand, he dressed the wound. When he had
finished, Lilly drew the sleeve down and fastened
it over the bandage.</p>

<p>Horton looked into her face. She was deadly
pale, and her hands, which had touched his once
or twice during the operation, were like ice.</p>

<p>"You are weak and unstrung. You have lost
a great deal of blood. Sit down, Miss O'Connell."</p>

<p>She did so, and there was a little silence. The
young man's nerves were still thrilling with the
excitement of the last hour. For the moment,
this girl&mdash;sitting there before him, this fair girl
with her hard, cruel destiny&mdash;filled him completely.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" he asked, at
length.</p>

<p>"Do?" she repeated. "Nothing."</p>

<p>"You will let this villain escape justice?" he
said. "You will take no measures to protect
yourself?"</p>

<p>Lilly raised her head. A look of intense bitterness
swept across her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall not do anything," she said. "Doctor
Horton, you have always been good to me. As
far back as I can remember, you have been my
friend. I want you to promise me not to speak
of what has happened to-night."</p>

<p>Horton bit his lips in perplexity.</p>

<p>"I do not think I have any right to make such
a promise," he said, after a little pause. "This
was an attempt at murder."</p>

<p>She rose and came close up to him.</p>

<p>"You <i>must</i> promise me. Do you not see?"
she went on, passionately. "If I were any one
else, it would be different&mdash;do you not understand?
To have my name dragged before the
public&mdash;I could not bear it! I would rather he
killed me outright!"</p>

<p>Doctor Horton walked the floor excitedly.</p>

<p>"It is a terrible thing," he said. "I cannot
blame you, but it does not seem right. Think the
matter over. Perhaps you will feel differently. In
the meantime, I will do nothing without your
consent."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Doctor Horton," she said.</p>

<p>A feeble call came from the sick-room, and she
turned away. Soon after, Doctor Horton left the
house.</p>

<p>The next day Commeraw's shop remained
closed, and it was discovered that he had fled
the town. Numerous debts and embarrassments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
which came to light sufficiently accounted for his
departure, and were also ample guarantee against
his return. In this way, the question which had
vexed Doctor Horton's mind was unexpectedly
settled.</p>

<p>He did not see Lilly O'Connell for several days,
but met her at last on the street in such a way
that she could not well avoid him.</p>

<p>"It goes against my sense of justice that that
scoundrel should escape so easily," he said, after
having made professional inquiries after the
wounded arm, "but at least you will now be safe,"
and, touching his hat respectfully, he turned to
leave her. At that instant, Miss Fairfield's phaeton
dashed around the corner. The occupant
drew the reins slightly and regarded the two with
a flash of the turquoise eyes; then, bowing coldly,
she gave her horse a touch of the whip and dashed
on again.</p>

<p>When Horton appeared at Mrs. Fairfield's that
evening, however, Florence received him with unusual
sweetness, and when chided playfully for the
coldness of her greeting on the street, replied only
with a light laugh.</p>

<p>The next morning rain was falling steadily, but
it did not prevent Miss Fairfield from appearing in
Miss Bullins's shop, taut and trim in her blue flannel
suit, the yellow hair and delicate rose-tinted
face finely relieved against the black velvet lin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>ing
of her hat. She found Lilly O'Connell in attendance
and the shop otherwise unoccupied, as
she had expected. She was very gracious. She
brought with her a parcel containing costly linen
and laces, which she wished made into mysterious
garments after the imported models inclosed.</p>

<p>"My dresses will be made in Boston," she
explained, with a conscious blush, "but I want
these things made under my own supervision&mdash;and
I want <i>you</i> to make them."</p>

<p>What was it in her crisp, clear tones which gave
the common words so subtle an effect? The two
girls looked each other full in the face for a moment.
Miss Fairfield was the first to look away.</p>

<p>"You do your work so beautifully, you know,"
she added, with a very sweet smile.</p>

<p>There was nothing more to say, yet she sauntered
about the shop awhile, looking at the goods
displayed, or out into the rainy street.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to see you looking so badly," she
said, at last, turning her eyes suddenly upon the
pale face behind the counter. "But I don't wonder,
either. It is natural you should take it hard."</p>

<p>Again the gray eyes met the blue in that mute
encounter.</p>

<p>"I don't think I know what you mean," said
Lilly, her fingers tightening upon the laces she was
folding.</p>

<p>Miss Fairfield raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, of course," she went on, sympathetically,
"of course, you don't like to talk about it, but I'm
sure <i>you</i> are not in the least to blame. It was
shameful of Commeraw to go off the way he did.
I am really sorry for you. <i>Good</i>-morning!"</p>

<p>A moment later, when she was well outside, a
little laugh broke from her lips. It had been
very well done&mdash;even better than she had meant to
do it.</p>

<p>The new minister, a susceptible young man,
meeting her at this moment, thought he had never
seen his fair parishioner looking so charming.</p>

<p>Just after, he was equally struck by another face,
framed in reddish-golden hair, which was gazing
out from the milliner's window at the murky sky.
Its set, hopeless expression startled him.</p>

<p>"What a remarkable face!" he reflected. "It
is that girl whose voice I noticed the other evening."
And, being a well-meaning young man, he
mentally added, "I really must speak with her,
next conference-meeting."</p>

<p>Summer passed tranquilly away, autumn ran its
brief course; and in November, when the days
were getting toward their shortest and dreariest,
something happened which startled quiet Ridgemont
out of the even tenor of its way. The small-pox
broke out among the operatives in the paper-mill,
and spread so rapidly during the first days as
to produce a universal panic. The streets were al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>most
deserted; houses were darkened, as if by
closed shutters one might shut out the fatal guest.
Those who were compelled to go about, or whose
social instinct overcame their fear, walked the
streets with a subdued and stealthy air, as if on the
lookout for an ambushed foe.</p>

<p>The village loafers were fewer in number, and
their hilarity was forced and spasmodic. Jokes of
a personal nature still circulated feebly, but seemed
to have lost their point and savor, and the laughter
which followed had a hollow ring. Mr. Hanniford
was visibly depressed, and the sallies which his
position as local humorist compelled him to utter
were of a ghastly description. He still endeavored
to enliven his labors with his favorite ditty,
but it had lost perceptibly in force and spirit.</p>

<p>Mr. Doolittle, the post-master, bore himself with
a dignified composure truly admirable, going fishing
more persistently and smoking more incessantly
than ever.</p>

<p>"What you want, boys," he remarked, with
great earnestness, to the few faithful retainers
whom the potent spell of gingerpop rendered insensible
to other considerations,&mdash;"what you want
is to take plenty of exercise in the open air, and
smoke freely. Tobacco is a great&mdash;a&mdash;prophylactic."</p>

<p>Meetings of citizens were held, and all the usual
sanitary means adopted and put in execution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
An uninhabited farm-house, whose rightful owner
was in some unknown part of the world, was chosen
for hospital uses, and thither all victims of
the disease were carried at once. From the beginning,
Dr. Horton had been most prompt and
active in suggesting prudential measures, and in
seeing them carried out. By universal consent,
he was invested with full powers. Dr. Starkey,
the only other physician, on the ground of failing
health, willingly submitted to the situation. The
young physician's entire energies were aroused.
He worked indefatigably, sparing neither strength
nor pocket; for among the victims were several
heads of families, whose sickness&mdash;and, in a few
cases, whose death&mdash;left want and misery behind
them.</p>

<p>One of the greatest obstacles encountered was
the scarcity of nurses, most of those responding to
the call becoming themselves victims in a few days.
Two men only&mdash;veteran soldiers&mdash;were equal to
the occasion, and acted in multifarious capacities&mdash;as
drivers of the ambulance, housekeepers, cooks,
nurses, undertakers, and grave-diggers.</p>

<p>On the evening when the certainty of the outbreak
was established, Dr. Horton, after a day of
excessive labor, went around to Mrs. Fairfield's.
It was a dark, rainy evening, and the house
seemed strangely cheerless and silent. A faint
light shone from one upper window, and he fancied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
as he reached the steps, that he saw a girlish figure
leaning against the window-sash. The housemaid
who admitted him, after a second ring, did so with
a hesitating and constrained air, eyed him askance
as she set her lamp upon the parlor table, and retreated
hastily.</p>

<p>He was kept waiting, too, as it seemed to him,
an unnecessarily long time. He was tired and a
little unstrung. He was in that mood when the
touch of a warm, tender hand is balm and cordial
at once, and the delay fretted him. He could hear
muffled footfalls over his head, and the murmur of
voices, as he wandered about the room, taking up
various small articles in a listless way, to throw
them down impatiently again; pulling about the
loose sheets of music on the piano, and wondering
why so lovely a creature as Florence need to be so
scrupulously exact about her toilet, with an impatient
lover chafing and fretting not twenty paces
away. But at last there was a sound of descending
footsteps, a rustling of skirts, and the door opened
to admit&mdash;Mrs. Fairfield. She, at all events, had
not been spending the precious moments at her toilet-table.
Something must have thrown her off her
guard. She was negligent in her attire, and certain
nameless signs of the blighting touch of Time
were allowed to appear, it may be safely asserted
for the first time, to the eyes of mortal man. She
was also flustered in manner, and, after giving Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Horton the tips of her cold fingers, retreated to the
remotest corner of the room, and sank into an easy-chair.
He noticed as she swept by him that her
person exhaled camphor like a furrier's shop.</p>

<p>"It's dreadful, isn't it?" she murmured, plaintively,
holding a handkerchief saturated with that
drug before her face. "Perfectly dreadful!"</p>

<p>Dr. Horton was at first puzzled, and then, as the
meaning of her remark came to him, a good deal
amused. He had not felt like laughing, all day;
but now he was obliged to smile, in the palm of
his hand, at the small, agitated countenance of his
future mother-in-law, seen for the first time without
"war-paint or feathers."</p>

<p>"It is certainly a misfortune," he said, reassuringly;
"but it is not wise to become excited.
The disease is confined at present to the lower part
of the town, and, with the precautions which are
to be taken, it will hardly spread beyond it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield shook her head incredulously.</p>

<p>"There's no telling," she murmured, sniffing at
her handkerchief with a mournful air.</p>

<p>"I have only a few moments to stay," the young
man said, after a slight pause. "I have to attend
a citizens' meeting. Is not Florence well?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes, she is well," came in hesitating and
muffled accents from behind the handkerchief.
"She is not <i>ill</i>, but she is terribly upset by the
state of things, poor child! She has <i>such</i> a horror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of disease! Why, she can't bear to come near me
when I have one of my sick headaches. So sensitive,
you know. So&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A light had gradually been breaking upon Horton's
mind. He colored, and stepped forward a
little. He had not been asked to sit down, and
was still in overcoat and gloves.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, slowly, looking Mrs. Fairfield
full in the face,&mdash;"I <i>suppose</i> I know what you
mean. Florence will not come down. She is
afraid to&mdash;to see me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield fidgeted in her chair, and a red
spot burned in her sallow cheek.</p>

<p>"You must not think strange of it, Roger,"
she began, volubly. "You know how delicately
organized Florence is. So nervous and excitable.
And it would be <i>such</i> a misfortune&mdash;with her complexion!"</p>

<p>Dr. Horton took one or two turns across the
room. He was not apt to speak on impulse, and
he waited now. He stopped before a portrait of
Florence, which hung over the piano. The tender
face looked out upon him with the soft, beguiling
smile about the small, curved lips, which had become
so dear to him. Above it was a bunch of
gorgeous sumac, which he had gathered for her
one heavenly day, not long ago; and on the piano-rack
stood the song she had taught him to believe
the sweetest song in all the world:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Du bist wie eine Blume,</div>
<div class="line">So schön, so hold, so rein."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He looked at the face again. She <i>was</i> "like a
flower." How could he have found it in his heart
to blame her, even by the remotest thought?</p>

<p>"I'm sure," came the plaintive voice again,
"you ought not to blame her. I think it's perfectly
natural."</p>

<p>Dr. Horton turned toward her, with a cheerful
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is quite natural. Of course I have
taken every precaution; but it was wrong of me
to come without finding out how she felt. Tell
her I will not come again until"&mdash;he paused, with
an unpleasant feeling in his throat&mdash;"until she
wishes me to come."</p>

<p>"Well, I am sure," said Mrs. Fairfield, rising
with an alacrity which betrayed how great was her
relief, "you must know what a trial it is to her,
Roger. The poor girl feels <i>so</i> badly. You are
not angry?" giving her hand, but holding the
camphorated handkerchief between them.</p>

<p>"No," Dr. Horton said, taking the reluctant
fingers a moment, "not at all angry."</p>

<p>He went away into the outer darkness, walking
a little heavily. The house-door shut behind him
with a harsh, inhospitable clang, and as he went
down the steps the wind blew a naked, dripping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
woodbine-spray sharply against his cheek, giving
him a curiously unpleasant thrill.</p>

<p>When he was part way down the walk, he
looked back. At the upper window the girlish
figure was still visible, the face still pressed against
the pane. His heart bounded at the sight, and
then sank with a sense of remoteness and loss for
which, a moment later, he chided himself bitterly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield waited only until she believed
Roger was off the grounds, when she threw open
all the windows in the room, sprinkled everything
liberally with carbolic acid, and went up-stairs to
her daughter.</p>

<p>She found Florence standing at the window
where she had left her.</p>

<p>"What did he say?" she asked, without looking
around.</p>

<p>"Oh, he was very reasonable," Mrs. Fairfield
answered, seizing the camphor-bottle from the
bureau, "very, indeed. He said it was wrong in
him to have come under such circumstances, and he
would not come again until the danger was over.
Roger always was so sensible."</p>

<p>Tears rolled from the girl's eyes down over her
blue cashmere wrapper, and she bit her lips to
keep back the sobs which threatened to break out.</p>

<p>"Hannah says three more cases were reported
to-night," said her mother, re-entering, after a
short absence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
An exclamation escaped the girl's lips, and she
wrung her fingers nervously.</p>

<p>"We'd better go, hadn't we?" said Mrs. Fairfield.</p>

<p>"No!" cried the girl. "Yes! Oh, I don't
know! I don't know!" and she threw herself
upon the bed, crying hysterically.</p>

<p>The evil news being corroborated by the milkman
next morning, led to another conference between
mother and daughter, the result of which
was that the following notes awaited Dr. Horton
on his return from an exhausting day's work:</p>

<p class="p2 i2">"<span class="smcap">My Dearest Roger</span>: Do not be <i>too</i> much hurt or shocked to
hear that mother and I have left town on the 3.30 train. We think
it best. It is hard, of course; but the separation will be easier than
if we were in the same place. I assure you, dear Roger, it pains me
to go, <i>dreadfully</i>; but I cannot bear such a strain upon my nerves.
Do, dearest, take care of yourself&mdash;though, of course, you won't take
the disease. Doctors never do, I believe. I don't see why, I'm sure.</p>

<p class="i2">"Oh, how I wish you had settled in Boston, or some large place,
where your practice would have been among first-class people only.
Those low mill people are always breaking out with some horrid
thing or other. It is too bad. We are going to stay with Aunt
Kitty, in Boston. She has been wanting me to spend the winter
with her. She is very gay, but of course, dearest, I shall have no
interest in <i>anything</i>. Of course you will write.</p>

<p class="right">"Your own, as ever,</p>

<p class="right3">"F. F."</p>


<p class="p2">Doctor Horton read this letter twice before
opening the other, which was from Mrs. Fairfield
herself, and ran as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 i2">"<span class="smcap">My Dear Roger</span>: I am sure you will not blame me for taking
our darling Flossie out of harm's way, nor her for going. As I
told her last night, you always were so sensible. The poor child has
been in such a state, you've no idea! We feel real anxious about
you. Do take every precaution, for Flossie's sake, though they say
doctors never take diseases. Do wear a camphor-bag somewhere
about you. I always did wish you had chosen the law&mdash;it is so
much nicer. Of course Flossie will expect letters, but don't you
think you had better soak the paper and envelopes in carbolic acid
beforehand? They say it's very efficacious.</p>

<p class="right">"Yours, affectionately,</p>
<p class="right3 smcap">"A. Fairfield.</p>


<p class="i2 p2">"P. S.&mdash;You have no idea how the darling child's spirits have
risen since we began packing. She is quite another creature.</p>

<p class="right3">"A. F."</p>

<p class="p2">Doctor Horton smiled as he read, but as he put
both notes away in his desk, his face became grave
and sad again.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly natural," he said to himself, as
he went down to his lonely tea. "Perfectly so,
and I am glad she has gone. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The terrible disease whose presence had sent
such a thrill of horror through the quiet little town
had been raging for two weeks, and though the inevitable
rebound from the first pressure of dread
was making itself universally felt, as a topic of conversation
it had lost none of its charms.</p>

<p>On a wild, wet afternoon, Lilly O'Connell sat in
the stuffy work-room sacred to the mysteries of
making and trying on the wonderful productions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of Miss Bullins's scissors and needle. She was
sewing the folds upon a dress of cheap mourning,
while Miss Bullins sat opposite with lap-board and
scissors, her nimble tongue outrunning the latter
by long odds.</p>

<p>"What's friends <i>for</i>," she was saying, "if they
aint goin' to stand by you when the pinch comes?
Folks that's got husbands and lovers and friends a
plenty don't realize their blessin's. As for Florence
Fairfield, it makes me ashamed of bein' a
woman&mdash;the way that girl did! They say she
wouldn't even see Roger Horton to bid him good-by.
I never heard the like!"</p>

<p>Lilly turned her head toward the window, perhaps
because the dress in her hands was black, and
the light dull.</p>

<p>"They say he's workin' himself to death for all
them poor people, and he aint got nobody&mdash;no
sister nor mother&mdash;to nurse him up when he comes
home all tuckered out; though Nancy Swift thinks
a sight of him, and she'll do her duty by him, I
make no doubt. He's just like his father, and he
<i>was</i> a good man. Florence Fairfield don't deserve
her privileges, I'm afeard."</p>

<p>The street door opened, and with a gust of cold
wind entered Widow Gatchell, the village "Sairey
Gamp." She was an elderly woman, tall, stiff and
dry as a last year's mullein-stalk. Her dark, wrinkled
face was fixed and inexpressive, but the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
black eyes were full of life. She was clothed in
rusty garments, and carried a seedy carpet-sack in
her hand.</p>

<p>"How d'ye do?" she said, in a dry voice,
dropping on to the edge of a chair. "I jest come
in to tell ye, if ye was <i>drove</i>, 'taint no matter about
my bunnit. I sha'n't want it right away."</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Miss Bullins, looking up.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to the pest-house nussin' to-morrow,"
returned the old woman, in the same quiet tone.</p>

<p>"Good land! Sarah Gatchell!" cried Miss
Bullins, upsetting her lap-board. "Aint you 'most
afraid?"</p>

<p>A quaint smile flitted across the widow's face.</p>

<p>"What'd I be afeared of," she said, "'s old 'n'
homely 's I be? The small-pox aint agoin' to
touch <i>me</i>. I'd 'a' gone a week ago, but I couldn't
leave Mis' Merrill, an' her baby not a week old.
I've jess been a-talkin' with Dr. Horton," she went
on. "He says they're sufferin' for help. They's
three sick women an' two children, an' not a woman
in the house to do a thing for 'em. They've
been expectin' two nusses from the city, but they
aint come. Seems to me 'taint jest right fur
men-folks to be fussin' 'round sick women an'
childern."</p>

<p>"Oh my, it's awful!" sighed Miss Bullins, pinning
her pattern crooked in her distress.</p>

<p>"Not a woman there?" said Lilly O'Connell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
who had been listening with her hands idle in her
lap.</p>

<p>"There'll <i>be</i> one there in the mornin'," said the
widow, rising to go. "I'd 'a' gone to-night, but I
couldn't be o' much use till I'd gone 'round the
house by daylight, an' got the hang o' things."</p>

<p>"Wall, you've got good grit, Sarah," said the
milliner, with enthusiasm. "You're as good as
half a dozen common women. I declare, I'd go
myself, but I shouldn't be a bit o' use. I should
catch it in a day. I was always a great one for
catchin' diseases."</p>

<p>"Aint ye well?" said Mrs. Gatchell, turning
suddenly toward Lilly. "Ye look kind o' peakèd.
I guess ye set still too much."</p>

<p>"I am perfectly well," said Lilly.</p>

<p>"Ye be? Wall, sewin' <i>is</i> confinin'. Good-by."</p>

<p>Lilly had no appetite for her tea, and immediately
after she put on her cloak and hat, and went
out. The wind had gone down as the sun set,
the rain had ceased, and a few pale stars were
struggling through the thin, vapory clouds.</p>

<p>The streets were very quiet, and she met but few
people. The choir in the Orthodox Church were
rehearsing, their voices ringing out clear and not inharmonious
in a favorite hymn. She stopped, and
bowing her head upon one of the square wooden
posts, waited until the hymn closed. Then she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
went on her way. It was quite dark when she
reached the end of her walk&mdash;the residence of Dr.
Starkey. She seized the brass knocker with a
firm hand, and was shown into the office. In a few
moments Dr. Starkey entered.</p>

<p>He was an old-school physician, and an old-school
gentleman as well. He would have considered
it indecent to appear before the world in any
other garb than a broadcloth swallow-tail coat of
ancient date, and with his long neck wrapped in
white lawn nearly to the point of suffocation. He
entered the room, and bowed with courtly gallantry
on seeing a feminine figure standing by the
table; but, as Lilly looked up and the lamp-light
fell upon her face and hair, there was a perceptible
congealing of his manner.</p>

<p>"Miss&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"I am Lilly O'Connell," she said, simply.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;a&mdash;yes! Miss O'Connell. Hm! Sit
down, Miss O'Connell,&mdash;sit down!" he added, observing
her closely from under his shaggy brows.</p>

<p>The girl remained standing, but the doctor seated
himself before the glowing grate, and placed
himself in an attitude of professional attention.</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;indisposed?" he asked, presently,
as she remained silent.</p>

<p>"No; I am quite well," she answered; and
then, after a little pause, during which her color
mounted and faded, she continued: "I have heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
that there is need of more help at the hospital, and
I came to ask you to take me as nurse, or anything
you most need."</p>

<p>Her voice trembled a little, and her eyes were
fixed eagerly upon the doctor's face.</p>

<p>He turned square about, the withered, purple-veined
hands clutching the arms of his chair tightly,
a kind of choking sound issuing from his bandaged
throat.</p>

<p>"Will you say that again?" he asked abruptly,
staring with raised eyebrows at the pale, earnest
face.</p>

<p>Lilly repeated what she had said, more firmly.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" ejaculated the old man,
measuring the girl from head to foot slowly.</p>

<p>"Child," he said, after a pause, "do you know
what you are talking about?"</p>

<p>"I think so," the girl answered, quietly.</p>

<p>"No, you do not!" the old man said, almost
brusquely. "It is a place to try the nerves of the
strongest man, to say nothing of a woman's. It is
no place for a girl&mdash;no place."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," the girl said, her voice breaking.
"They say I am good in sickness, and I will
do any kind of work. It is dreadful to think of
those poor little children and women, with no one
to do anything for them but men. Oh, do not refuse!"
she cried, coming nearer and holding out
her hands entreatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor had fidgeted in his chair, uttering a
variety of curious, inarticulate exclamations while
she was speaking.</p>

<p>"But, child," he repeated, earnestly, "it would
be as much as your life is worth to enter the house.
You would come down in a week. You might
die!"</p>

<p>Lilly looked up into the mottled old face, and
smiled sadly.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," she said again, "and there is
no one to care very much. Even if I should die,
it would not matter."</p>

<p>Dr. Starkey reflected, rubbing one shrivelled finger
up and down the bridge of his nose. He knew
how woman's help was needed in that abode of
pestilence and death. He looked at the white,
supple hands clasped over the gray cloak before
him, and thought of the work which they would be
required to perform, then shook his head slowly,
and rose.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I cannot consent."</p>

<p>Lilly made a motion as if to speak, but he raised
his hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"It would be as bad as murder," he went on.
"I respect your motive, Miss O'Connell, I do, indeed;
but you are too young and too&mdash;a&mdash;delicate
for the undertaking. Don't think of it any
more."</p>

<p>He took one of the hands which dropped at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
side and held it in his glazed palm, looking kindly
into the downcast face. He knew the girl's whole
history. He had been one of the fiercest opponents
of her application for a teacher's place, and
from conscientious motives solely, as he believed;
but he remembered it now with sharp regret.
There was nothing in this fair and womanly figure
to inspire antipathy, surely. For the first time, a
realizing sense of her solitary life came to him, and
he was pained and sorry. He wanted to be very
kind to her, but felt strangely unable to express
himself.</p>

<p>"Don't say no one would care what befell you,"
he began, his gruff voice softening. "A young
woman of your&mdash;a&mdash;attractions should have many
friends. Consider <i>me</i> one, Miss O'Connell," he
continued, with a blending of the sincere and the
grandiose in his manner,&mdash;"consider <i>me</i> a friend
from this day, and let me thank you again for your
offer. It was very praiseworthy of you, very."</p>

<p>Lilly bowed&mdash;she could not trust herself to
speak&mdash;and went away.</p>

<p>Dr. Starkey walked up and down his office several
times, raised and lowered the flame of the
lamp, poked the fire, looked out into the starlit
night, and, with a fervent "Bless my soul! how
extraordinary!" settled himself for his customary
nap over the Boston paper.</p>

<p>Lilly hurried home through the silent streets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Miss Bullins's shop was empty of customers, and
she herself, her hair bristling with crimping-pins
and curl-papers, was putting things in order for
the night. She studied Lilly's face with watchful
anxiety, as she joined in her labors.</p>

<p>"I hope to gracious she aint comin' down
sick!" she reflected. "You aint got backache
and pains in your limbs, have you?" she inquired,
with thinly veiled anxiety.</p>

<p>Lilly laughed.</p>

<p>"No, Miss Bullins; nothing of the kind."</p>

<p>"I thought you looked kind o' <i>queer</i>," said the
good creature, coloring.</p>

<p>"I am only a little tired; not sick."</p>

<p>She came and stood by the old maid's chair, as
she sat warming her feet at the stove, and laid her
hand on the thin gray hair.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Miss Bullins."</p>

<p>"Good-night, dear. Hadn't you better drink a
cup of pepper-tea before you go to bed?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you; I am only tired."</p>

<p>She sat by the window of her little bedroom
over the shop a long time before lighting her
lamp. Dim and dark, the river wound along, its
surface gleaming here and there faintly through
the leafless branches of the willows. Overhead,
the solemn stars shone coldly. The houses along
its banks were already dark and silent. At some
involuntary movement, her hand fell upon a soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
white mass of needle-work which strewed the table
near her, and the contact seemed to rouse her.
She rose, lit the lamp, folded the dainty, lace-trimmed
garment, and made it into a parcel with
some others which she took from a drawer, and
went to bed. It was long before she slept, but the
early morning found her asleep, with a peaceful
smile upon her face.</p>

<p>The next day, being Saturday, was a busy one,
for let Death stalk as he will, people must have
their Sunday gear. The little shop was full at
times, and feminine tongues and fingers flew without
cessation, mixing millinery and misery in
strange confusion.</p>

<p>"You don't say that's Mis' Belden's bonnet, with
all them flowers on it? Well, I never! And she
a member!"</p>

<p>"Why, you're a member, too, ain't you, Mis' Allen?"
says another, with a glance at the first speaker's
head, where feathers of various hues waved
majestically.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean my feathers?" was the spirited
answer. "Feathers an' <i>flowers</i> is different things.
You must draw the line somewhere, an' I draw it
at feathers."</p>

<p>"They say one o' the women died up to the pest-house
yesterday," said one woman, in the midst
of an earnest discussion as to the comparative becomingness
of blue roses and crimson pansies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Miss Bullins, compassionately,
"an' not a woman there to lay her out!
Sarah Gatchell didn't go up till to-day."</p>

<p>"They don't lay 'em out," remarked the other,
unconcernedly, holding a brilliant pansy against
her bilious countenance. "They roll 'em up in
the sheet they die on, and bury 'em in the pasture."</p>

<p>Lilly's hands trembled over the bonnet she was
lining.</p>

<p>"Well, good-day, Miss Bullins. I guess I'd
better take the roses. I'm most too old for red.
Get it done if you can. Good-day."</p>

<p>It went on so all day. At one time there was a
rush for the window.</p>

<p>"It's Doctor Horton!" cried a pretty girl. "Oh
my! Ain't he sweet? He's handsomer than ever,
since he got so pale. I don't see how in the world
Flossie Fairfield could do as she did. They say
she's afraid to have him write to her."</p>

<p>"She loves her good looks more'n she does him,
I guess," said another.</p>

<p>"And they to be married in the spring," said
Miss Bullins, pathetically. "Lilly, here, was making
her underclo'se, and they're a sight to see,&mdash;all
hand-made, and so much lace in 'em that it ain't
modest, I do declare!"</p>

<p>"If she got her deserts she wouldn't have no use
for weddin' clo'se," said another, with acerbity;
"not if <i>I</i> was Roger Horton."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wall, you ain't," said her companion, drily,
"an' he ain't no different from other men, I guess."</p>

<p>Lilly worked on with feverish haste. About four
o'clock she rose and went out, pausing an instant
at the door, and looking back. Miss Bullins, intent
upon some button-holes for which every moment
of daylight was needed, did not look up.
Lilly closed the door, and went up to her room.</p>

<p>It was small and simple, but it was the best she
had known. There were some innocent efforts at
decoration, a daintiness about the bed, a few books
on hanging shelves, and a pretty drapery at the one
window. She looked around with a sinking heart.
There was a small writing-desk upon the table, and
she went to it and wrote a few lines, which she
sealed and directed. She packed a few articles in
a satchel, put on her cloak and hat, and stole down
the stairs.</p>

<p>Choosing the quietest street, she walked rapidly
through the village until the last house was passed,
and the open country lay before her, bare and
brown and desolate, except for the blue hills in
the distance, which, summer or winter, never lost
their beauty.</p>

<p>Two or three farmers, jogging homeward with
their week's supplies, passed her, and one offered
her a lift as far as she was going, which she declined.</p>

<p>A mile from the village, a road turned off to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
left, winding through barren fields, until lost in the
pine woods. As she turned into this, a man driving
toward the village reined in and called to her,
warningly:</p>

<p>"The pest-house is up yonder!"</p>

<p>She merely bowed and kept on. The man stared
a moment, and whipped up his horse again. It
was dark in the woods, and chilly, but she felt no
fear, not even when the sere bushes by the way-side
rustled, or twigs snapped as if beneath the tread of
some living creature.</p>

<p>As she came out into comparative light she saw
a buggy driven rapidly toward her. She recognized
its occupant at once, and with a quick heart-throb
sprang behind a clump of young pines, and
dropped upon her knees.</p>

<p>Dr. Horton drove by, his face turned toward her
place of concealment. He did not know that any
human eye was upon him, and the heaviness of his
spirit appeared unrepressed in every feature. His
eyes followed listlessly the irregular outline of the
way-side walls and bushes, but it was evident that
his thoughts were not of surrounding things, otherwise
he must have seen the crouching figure and
the white face pressed against the rough bark of
the tree whose trunk she clasped.</p>

<p>The girl's eyes followed him until he was lost to
sight in the woods. Then she came out and pursued
her way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>A curve in the road brought her in sight of the
house now devoted to hospital uses. It was a two-story
farm-house, black with age, shutterless and
forsaken-looking. Over it hung the cloud of a
hideous crime. A few years before, the owner,
led on by an insane passion, had murdered his aged
wife in her bed. The sequel had been a man's life
ended in prison, a girl's name blasted, a dishonored
family, a forsaken homestead,&mdash;for the son, to whom
the property had fallen, had gone away, leaving no
trace behind him. It had stood for years as the
murderer had left it; its contents had been untouched
by human hands; the hay had rotted in
the barn; the fields were running waste. The very
road itself was avoided, and the old wheel-ruts
were almost effaced by grass and weeds. Swallows
had possessed themselves of the cold, smokeless
chimneys and sunken, mossy eaves; vagrant cats
prowled about the moldering mows and empty
mangers. The old well-sweep pointed like a gaunt,
rigid finger toward heaven. The little strips of
flower-beds beneath the front windows were choked
with grass, but the red roses and pinks and columbines
which the old woman had loved, still grew
and bloomed in their season, and cast their petals
about the sunken door-stone, and over the crooked
path and neglected grass.</p>

<p>There were no flowers now,&mdash;only drifting masses
of wet brown leaves. The setting sun had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
turned the windows into sheets of blood, and down
in the pasture could be seen the rough clods of
several new-made graves. The silence was absolute.
Faint columns of smoke, rising from the
crumbling chimneys, were the only signs of human
presence.</p>

<p>A tremor shook the girl from head to foot, and
she ceased walking. After all, she was young and
strong, and the world was wide; life might hold
something of sweetness for her yet. It was not
too late. She half turned,&mdash;but it was only for a
moment, and her feet were on the door-step, and
her hand on the latch.</p>

<p>She turned a last look upon the outer world,&mdash;the
bare fields, the leafless woods, the blue hills,
the fading sky. A desperate yearning toward it
all made her stretch out her hands as if to draw
it nearer for a last farewell. Then from within
came the piteous cry of a sick child, and she raised
the latch softly and entered the house. The air of
the hall smote her like a heavy hand, coming as
she did from the cool outer air; but guided by the
cry, which still continued, she groped her way up
the bare, worn stairs, pushed open a door, and entered.</p>

<p>The child's voice covered the sound of her entrance
and, sickened by the foul air, she had
leaned for some moments against the wall before
Widow Gatchell, who was holding the child across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
her knee, turned and saw her. The old woman's
hard, brown features stiffened with surprise, her
lips parted without sound.</p>

<p>"I have come to help you," said Lilly, putting
down her satchel and coming forward.</p>

<p>"Who sent ye?" the widow asked, shortly.</p>

<p>"Nobody. I offered my services, but Dr.
Starkey refused to let me come. I knew you
would not send me away if I once got here, and so
I came."</p>

<p>"What was folks thinkin' of to <i>let</i> ye come?"
asked the old woman again.</p>

<p>"Nobody knew it," Lilly answered.</p>

<p>"Wall," the widow said, "ye had no sort o'
business to come, though the Lord knows they's
need enough of help."</p>

<p>"Perhaps <i>He</i> sent me, Sarah," the girl said,
gently. "Oh, the poor, poor baby! Let me
take it."</p>

<p>Widow Gatchell's keen eyes swept the girl's
compassionate face with a searching gaze. She
rose stiffly and laid the child in her arms.</p>

<p>"There!" she said, drawing a long breath.
"You're in for it now, Lilly O'Connell, and may
the Lord have mercy on ye!"</p>

<p>When Dr. Horton entered the pest-house in the
morning, the first person he encountered was Lilly
O'Connell, coming through the hall with a tray in
her hands. In her closely fitting print dress and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
wide apron, the sleeves turned back from her
smooth, strong arms, her face earnest, yet cheerful,
she was the embodiment of womanly charity
and sweetness. He started as though he saw a
spectre.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he said; "how came you
here? Who&mdash;who permitted you to come here?"</p>

<p>"No one," said Lilly, supporting the waiter on
the post at the foot of the stairs. "I just came.
I asked Dr. Starkey to take me as nurse, but he
refused."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," said the young man. He
stepped back and opened the door, letting in the
crisp morning air. "But why did you come? It
is a terrible place for you."</p>

<p>"I came to be of use," she answered, smiling.
"I hope I am useful. Ask Mrs. Gatchell. She
will tell you that I am useful, I am sure."</p>

<p>Horton's face expressed pain and perplexity.</p>

<p>"It is wrong&mdash;all wrong," he said. "Where
were your friends? Was there no one who cared
for you, no one that you care for, enough to keep
you from this wild step?"</p>

<p>She looked up into his face, and, for one brief
moment, something in her deep, luminous eyes
chained his gaze. A soft red spread itself over
her cheeks and neck. She shook her head slowly,
and taking up the tray, went on up the stairs.</p>

<p>Miss Bullins found the little note which Lilly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
had left for her, when, as no response came to her
repeated summons to tea, she mounted the stairs
to see what had happened.</p>

<p>She read the hastily written lines with gathering
tears.</p>


<p class="i2 p2">"You can get plenty of milliners and seamstresses; but those
poor women and children are suffering for some one to take care of
them. Forgive me for going this way, but it seemed the only way
I <i>could</i> go. May be I shall be sick; but if I do, there is no beauty
to lose, you know, and if I die, there is nobody to break their heart
about it. <i>You</i> will be sorry, I know. I thank you, oh so much,
for all your kindness to me, and I do love you dearly. May God
bless you for all your goodness. If I should die, what I leave is for
you to do what you please with.</p>

<p class="right">"Your grateful and loving</p>

<p class="right smcap">"Lilly."</p>

<p class="p2">The good little woman's tears fell faster as she
looked about the empty room.</p>

<p>"I never was so beat in my life," she confided
to a dozen of her intimate friends many times over
during the next week. "You could have knocked
me down with a feather."</p>

<p>Dr. Starkey's amazement surpassed Miss Bullins's,
if possible. He first heard of the step Lilly
had taken from Dr. Horton. He saw her himself
a day or two later, on making his tri-weekly visit
to the hospital, and commended her bravery and
self-sacrificing spirit in phrases something less
stilted than usual.</p>

<p>He could not entirely banish an uneasy feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
when he looked at the fresh young face, but he
became tolerably reconciled to the situation when
he saw what her energy and tenderness, in cooperation
with Widow Gatchell's skill and experience,
were accomplishing.</p>

<p>As for the girl herself, the days and nights
passed so rapidly, making such demands upon
body and mind, as to leave no time for regret.
The scenes she witnessed effaced the past entirely
for the time. In the midst of all the pain, and
loathsomeness, and delirium, and death, she moved
about, strong, gentle and self-contained, so self-contained
that the vigilant eyes of the old nurse
followed her in mute surprise.</p>

<p>"I never see nothin' like it," she said to Dr.
Horton one day. "I've known her since she was
little, an' I never would 'a' believed it, though I
knew she'd changed. Why, she used to be so
high-strung an' techy, like, an' now she's like a
lamb."</p>

<p>On the tenth day after her coming, Dr. Horton
in making his round entered an upper chamber,
where Lilly was standing by one of the three beds
it contained. She had just drawn the sheet over
the faces of two who had died that morning&mdash;mother
and child.</p>

<p>The dead woman was the deserted wife of a man
who had left her a year before, young, weak and
ignorant, to certain want and degradation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot feel sorry," Lilly said. "It is so
much better for them than what was left for them
here."</p>

<p>Dr. Horton hardly seemed to hear her words.
He was leaning wearily against a chair behind
him; his eyes were dull, and his forehead contracted
as if with physical suffering.</p>

<p>"You are ill!" she said, with a startled gesture.</p>

<p>"No, only getting a little tired out. I hope
the worst is over now, and I think I shall hold
out."</p>

<p>He went about from room to room, and from
bed to bed, attentive and sympathetic as ever, and
then left the house. A half hour later, one of the
men came into the kitchen where Mrs. Gatchell
was stirring something over the fire.</p>

<p>"Got a spare bed?" he asked, laconically.</p>

<p>The widow looked up.</p>

<p>"'Cause we've got another patient."</p>

<p>"Who is it?" she asked, quickly.</p>

<p>"Come and see."</p>

<p>She followed the man to the rear of the house,
where, upon a stone which had fallen from the
wall, Dr. Horton was sitting, his head bent in
slumber. She listened a moment to his heavy
breathing, laid her hand upon his forehead, and
turned silently away.</p>

<p>A bed was made ready, and the young doctor,
still wrapped in the heavy sleep of disease, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
laid upon it, and one of the men was sent for Dr.
Starkey.</p>

<p>In the delirium which marks the first stages of
the disease, young Horton would allow no one
but Lilly O'Connell to minister to him. Sometimes
he imagined himself a boy, and called her
"mother," clinging to her hand, and moaning if
she made the least effort to withdraw. At other
times, another face haunted him, and another
name, coupled with endearing words or tender reproaches,
fell from the half-unconscious lips.</p>

<p>Who but a woman can comprehend the history
of those days and nights of watching and waiting?
Each morning found her more marble-pale; purple
rings formed themselves about the large eyes,
but a deep, steady light, which was not born of
pain and suffering, shone in their clear depths.</p>

<p>At last, one night, the crisis, whose result no
human judgment could foretell, was at hand. No
delirium, no restlessness now&mdash;only a deep sleep,
in which the tense muscles relaxed and the breath
came as softly as a child's.</p>

<p>Widow Gatchell shared the young girl's watch,
but the strain of the last month had told upon her,
and toward morning she fell asleep, and Lilly kept
her vigil alone. Only the ticking of the old clock
in the hall and the breathing of the sleepers broke
the deep silence which filled the house. The lamp
threw weird shadows across the ceiling and over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the disfigured face upon the pillow. Of all manly
beauty, only the close-clustering chestnut hair remained,
and the symmetrical hands which lay
nerveless and pale, but unmarred, upon the
spread.</p>

<p>Statue-like, the young girl sat by the bed-side,
her whole soul concentrated in the unwavering
gaze which rested upon the sleeper's face. A
faint&mdash;ever so faint&mdash;murmur came at last from the
hot, swollen lips, and one languid hand groped
weakly, as if seeking something. She took it
gently and held it between her own soft palms.
It seemed to her fine touch that a light moisture
was discernible upon it. She rose and bent over
the pillow with eager eyes. A storm of raptured
feeling shook her. She sank upon her knees by
the bed, and pressed the hand she held close
against her breast, whispering over it wild words
which no ear might hear.</p>

<p>All at once, the fingers which had lain so inert
and passive in her grasp seemed to her to thrill
with conscious life, to return faintly the pressure
of her own. She started back.</p>

<p>A ray of dawning light crept under the window-shade
and lay across the sick man's face. His
eyes were open, and regarding her with a look of
perfect intelligence.</p>

<p>The girl rose with a smothered cry, and laid the
drooping hand upon the bed. The dark, gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
eyes followed her beseechingly. It seemed as if
he would have spoken, but the parched lips had
lost their power.</p>

<p>She went to the sleeping woman and touched
her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Sarah, I think he is better," she said, her voice
trembling.</p>

<p>Instantly, the old nurse was on the alert. She
went to the bed, and laid her hand upon the sick
man's forehead and wrist, then turned toward
Lilly, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Go and take some rest," she said in a whisper.
"The crisis has passed. He will live."</p>

<p>Dr. Horton's recovery was not rapid, but it was
sure.</p>

<p>From the hour of his return to consciousness,
Lilly O'Connell had not entered his room.</p>

<p>When a week had passed, he ventured to question
his faithful attendant, Widow Gatchell, in regard
to her. For twenty-four hours he had missed
the step and voice he had believed to be hers, passing
and repassing the hall outside his door. The
old woman turned her back abruptly and began
stirring the already cheerful fire.</p>

<p>"She ain't quite so well to-day," she answered,
in a constrained voice.</p>

<p>The young man raised his head.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that she is sick?" he asked hastily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
"She was took down last night," the widow answered,
hesitating, and would have left the room;
but the young man beckoned her, and she went to
his side.</p>

<p>"Let everything possible be done for her," he
said. "You understand&mdash;everything that <i>can</i> be
done. Let Mason attend to me."</p>

<p>"I'll do <i>my</i> part," the old nurse answered, in
the peculiarly dry tone with which she was accustomed
to veil her emotions.</p>

<p>Dr. Starkey, who, since the young doctor's illness,
had been, perforce, in daily attendance, was
closely questioned. His answers, however, being
of that reserved and non-committal nature characteristic
of the profession, gave little satisfaction, and
Horton fell into a way of noticing and interpreting,
with the acute sense of the convalescent, each look
of his attendant, each sound which came to him,
keeping himself in a state of nervous tension which
did much toward retarding his recovery.</p>

<p>Three or four days had passed in this way, when
one morning, just at daybreak, Dr. Horton was
roused from his light sleep by sounds in the hall outside
his door&mdash;hushed voices, shuffling footsteps,
and the sound of some object striking with a heavy
thud against the balusters and wall. He raised
himself, his heart beating fast, and listened intently.
The shuffling steps moved on, down the
creaking stairs and across the bare floor below. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
door opened and shut, and deep silence filled the
house again. He sank back upon his pillow, faint
and bewildered, but still listening, and after some
moments, another sound reached his ears faintly
from a distance&mdash;the click of metal against stones
and frozen mold.</p>

<p>He had already been able, with some assistance,
to reach his chair once or twice a day; now he
rose unaided, and without consciousness of pain
or weakness, found his way to the window, and
pushed aside the paper shade with a shaking hand.</p>

<p>It was a dull, gray morning, and a light snow
was falling, but through the thin veil he could see
the vague outlines of two men in the pasture opposite,
and could follow their stiff, slow motions.
They were filling in a grave.</p>

<p>He went to his bed and lay back upon it with
closed eyes. When he opened them, Widow Gatchell
was standing by him with his breakfast on a
tray.</p>

<p>Her swarthy face was haggard, but her eyes
were tearless, and her lips set tightly together. He
put his hand out and touched hers.</p>

<p>"I know," he said, softly.</p>

<p>The woman put the tray on the table, and sank
upon a chair. She cleared her throat several times
before speaking.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, at last, in her dry, monotonous
voice. "She is gone. We did all we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
for her, but 'twarn't no use. She was all wore out
when she was took. Just afore she died she started
up and seized hold o' my hand, her eyes all soft
an' shinin', an' her mouth a-smilin'. 'Sarah,' says
she, 'I shall know the meaning of it now!' The
good Lord only knows what she meant&mdash;her mind
was wanderin', most likely&mdash;but them was her last
words, 'I shall know the meanin' of it now,
Sarah!'"</p>

<p>The old woman sat a while in silence, with the
strange repressed look which watching by so many
death-beds had fixed upon her face; then, arranging
the breakfast upon the stand, went out again.</p>

<p>It snowed persistently all day. From the chair
by the window, Doctor Horton watched it falling
silently, making everything beautiful as it fell,&mdash;rude
wall, and gnarled tree, and scraggy, leafless
bush,&mdash;and covering those low, unsightly mounds
with a rich and snowy pall. He watched it until
night fell and shut it from his sight.</p>

<p>Lilly O'Connell's was the last case. The disease
seemed meantime to have spent its force, and in a
few weeks the unbroken silence of midwinter rested
over the drear and forlorn spot.</p>

<p>Doctor Horton was again at home. He was
thin, and his face showed some traces of the disease
from which he had just recovered, but they
were slight, and such as would pass away in time.
The pleasant chamber where he was sitting was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
filled with evidences of care and attention, for
every woman in Ridgemont, old or young, desired
to show in some way her admiration and esteem
for the young physician. Fruit and jellies and
flowers and books filled every available place.</p>

<p>He was seated before a cheerful fire. Upon the
table by his side lay many papers and letters, the
accumulation of several weeks. One letter, of a
recent date, was open in his hand. A portion of
it ran thus:</p>

<p class="p2 i2">"*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It has been very gay here this season, and mother
and Aunt Kitty have insisted upon my going out a great deal. But
I have had no heart in it, dearest, especially since I knew that you
were ill. I assure you, I was almost ill myself when I heard of it.
How thankful I am that you are convalescent. I long to see you
so much, but Aunt Kitty does not think I ought to return before
spring. Oh Roger, <i>do</i> you think you are much changed?&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*"</p>

<p class="p2">Shading his eyes with his thin hand, he sat a
long time in deep thought. At last, rousing himself,
he went to his desk and wrote as follows:</p>


<p class="p2 i2">"<span class="smcap">My Dear Florence</span>: I <i>am</i> changed; so much that you
would not know me; so much that I hardly know myself; so much,
indeed, that it is better we do not meet at present.</p>

<p class="right3">R. H."</p>

<p class="p2">With a smile so bitter that it quite transformed his
genial, handsome face, he read and re-read these
lines.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said aloud, "it is the right way, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
only way," and he sealed and directed the letter,
and went back to his reverie by the fire.</p>

<p>Lilly O'Connell's death made a deep impression
in the village. That which her life, with all its pain
and humiliation and loneliness, its heroic struggles,
its quiet, hard-won victories, had failed to do, the
simple story of her death accomplished. It was
made the subject of at least two eloquent discourses,
and for a time her name was on every
tongue. But it was only for a time, for when, in
the course of years, the graves in the pasture were
opened, and the poor remains of mortality removed
by surviving friends to sacred ground, her grave
remained undisturbed.</p>

<p>It was not forgotten, however. One day in June,
when the happy, teeming earth was at her fairest,
Dr. Horton drove out of the village, and turning
into the grass-grown, untraversed road, went on
to the scene of the past winter's tragedy of suffering
and death. The old house was no longer in
existence. By consent of the owner (whose whereabouts
had been discovered), and by order of the
selectmen of the town, it had been burned to the
ground. Where it had stood, two crumbling chimneys
rose from the mass of blackened bricks and
charred timbers which filled the cellar, the whole
draped and matted with luxuriant woodbine and
clinging shrubs. Birds brooded over their nests
in every nook and cranny of the ruin, and red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
roses flaunted in the sunshine and sprinkled the
gray door-stone with splashes of color. The air
was as sweet about it, the sky as blue above it, as
if crime and plague were things which had no existence.</p>

<p>Dr. Horton left his horse to browse on the tender
leaves of the young birches which grew along
the wall, and went down into the pasture. The
sod above the graves was green, and starred with
small white flowers. There were fifteen graves in
all, distinguished only by a number rudely cut upon
rough stakes driven into the ground at their heads.</p>

<p>He went slowly among them until he came to
one a little apart from the others, in the shadow of
the woods which bordered the field. A slender
young aspen grew beside it, its quivering leaves
shining in the sun. Soft winds blew out from the
fragrant woods, and far off in their green depths
echoed the exquisite, melancholy note of the
wood-thrush. At the foot of the grave, where the
grass, nourished by some hidden spring, grew long
and lush, a single tiger-lily spread its glowing
chalice.</p>

<p>The young man stood there with uncovered head
a long, long time. Then, laying his hand reverently
upon the sod for one instant, he went away.</p>

<p>Several years have passed since these events.
Dr. Horton is still unmarried. This is a source of
great regret in the community with which he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
become so closely allied, and by which he is held
in universal regard and honor. There are some
prematurely whitened locks upon his temples, and
two or three fine straight lines just above his warm,
steadfast eyes, but he is neither a morose nor a
melancholy man, and there are those who confidently
hope that the many untenanted rooms in
the old homestead may yet open to the sunshine
of a wife's smile, and echo to the music of childish
voices.</p>

<p>It was two years before he met Miss Fairfield,
she having spent that time in Europe with her
mother and "Aunt Kitty." It was a chance meeting,
upon Tremont Street, in Boston. He was in
the act of leaving a store as she entered, accompanied
by her mother. He recognized them with
a friendly and courteous bow, and passed on.</p>

<p>Miss Fairfield leaned against the counter with a
face white as snow.</p>

<p>"He is not&mdash;changed&mdash;so very much," she
whispered to her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield, who had had her own ideas all
along, kept a discreet silence.</p>

<p>The Fairfields spend a part of their time in Ridgemont,
and the elegant little phaeton and the doctor's
buggy often pass each other on the street;
the occupants exchange greetings, and that is all.</p>

<p>Miss Fairfield is Miss Fairfield still. Always
elegant and artistic in her dress, she is not quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the same, however. The porcelain tints have faded,
and there is a sharpness about the delicate features,
and a peevishness about the small pink lips. She
is devoted to art. She paints industriously, and
with fair result. Her tea-sets are much sought
after, and she "spends her winters in Boston."</p>

<h2 id="THIRZA">THIRZA.</h2></div>


<p>She stood by the window, looking out over the
dreary landscape, a woman of some twenty-five
years, with an earnest, even melancholy face, in
which the wistful brown eyes were undoubtedly
the redeeming feature. Jones' Hill, taken at its
best, in full parade uniform of summer green, was
not renowned for beauty or picturesqueness, and
now, in fatigue dress of sodden brown stubble, with
occasional patches of dingy white in ditches and
hollows and along the edges of the dark pine woods,
was even less calculated to inspire the beholder
with enthusiasm. Still, that would hardly account
for the shadow which rested upon Thirza Bradford's
face. She ought, in fact, to have worn a cheerful
countenance. One week before she had been a
poor girl, dependent upon the labor of her hand
for her daily bread; to-day she was sole possessor
of a farm of considerable extent, the comfortable
old house at one of whose windows she was
now standing, and all that house's contents.</p>

<p>One week before she had been called to the bed-side
of her aunt, Abigail Leavitt. She had arrived
none too soon, for the stern, sad old woman had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
received her summons, and before another morning
dawned had passed away.</p>

<p>To her great surprise, Thirza found that her aunt
had left her sole heiress of all she had possessed.
Why she should have been surprised would be difficult
to explain. Aunt Abigail's two boys had
gone to the war and never returned, her husband
had been dead for many years, and Thirza was her
only sister's only child, and sole surviving relative.
Nothing, therefore, was more natural than this
event, but Thirza had simply never thought of it.
She had listened, half in wonder, half in indifference,
to the reading of the will, and had accepted
mechanically the grudgingly tendered congratulations
of the assembled farmers and their wives.</p>

<p>She had been supported in arranging and carrying
out the gloomy details of the funeral by Jane
Withers, a spinster of a type peculiar to New England;
one of those persons who, scorning to demean
themselves by "hiring out," go about, nevertheless,
from family to family, rendering reluctant service,
"just to accommodate" (accepting a weekly stipend
in the same spirit of accommodation, it is to be
supposed). With this person's assistance, Thirza
had prepared the repast to which, according to custom,
the mourners from a distance were invited on
their return from the burying-ground. Aunt Abigail
had been stricken down at the close of a Saturday's
baking, leaving a goodly array upon the pan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>try
shelves, a fact upon which Jane congratulated
herself without any attempt at concealment, observing,
in fact, that the melancholy event "couldn't
have happened handier." In vain had Thirza protested&mdash;Jane
was inflexible&mdash;and she had looked on
with silent horror, while the funeral guests devoured
with great relish the pies and ginger-bread which
the dead woman's hand had prepared.</p>

<p>"Mis' Leavitt were a master hand at pie-crust,"
remarked one toothless dame, mumbling at the
flaky paste, "a <i>master</i> hand at pie-crust, but she
never were much at bread!" whereupon the whole
feminine conclave launched out into a prolonged
and noisy discussion of the relative merits of salt-risin's,
milk-emptin's, and potato yeast.</p>

<p>That was three or four days ago, and Thirza had
remained in the old house with Jane, who had
kindly proffered her services and the solace of her
companionship. There had been little to do in the
house, and that little was soon done, and now the
question of what she was to do with her new acquisition
was looming up before her, and assuming
truly colossal proportions. She was thinking of it
now as she stood there with the wistful look upon
her face, almost wishing that Aunt Abigail had left
the farm to old Jabez Higgins, a fourth or fifth
cousin by marriage, who had dutifully appeared at
the funeral, with a look as if he had that within
which passed showing, and doubtless he had, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
he turned green and blue when the will was read,
and drove off soon after at a tearing pace.</p>

<p>Jane, having condescended to perform the operation
of washing up the two plates, cups, etc.,
which their evening meal had brought into requisition,
entered presently, knitting in hand, and seated
herself with much emphasis in a low wooden chair
near the window. She was an erect and angular
person, with an aggressive air of independence
about her, a kind of "just-as-good-as-you-are"
expression, which seemed to challenge the observer
to dispute it at his peril. She took up the first
stitch on her needle, fixed her sharp eyes upon
Thirza, and, as if in answer to her thoughts, opened
on her as follows:</p>

<p>"Ye haint made up yer mind what ye're a-goin'
ter dew, hev ye?"</p>

<p>Thirza slowly shook her head, without looking
around.</p>

<p>"It's kind o' queer now how things does work
a-round. There you was a-workin' an' a-slavin' in
that old mill, day in an' day out, only a week ago,
an' now you can jest settle right down on yer own
place an' take things easy."</p>

<p>Thirza vaguely wondered why Aunt Abigail had
never "taken things easy."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder a mite," went on Jane, with
increasing animation, "I shouldn't wonder a single
mite if you should git a husband, after all!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Thirza's pale face flushed, and she made an involuntary
gesture of impatience with one shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, ye needn't twist around so," said the undaunted
spinster, dryly. "Ye ain't no chicken,
laws knows, but ye needn't give up all hopes. Ye're
twenty-five if ye're a day, but that ain't nothin' when
a woman's got a farm worth three thousand dollars."</p>

<p>Three thousand dollars! For the first time her
inheritance assumed its monetary value before
Thirza's eyes. Hitherto she had regarded it merely
as an indefinite extent of pastures, woods, and
swamps&mdash;but three thousand dollars! It sounded
like a deal of money to her, who had never owned
a hundred dollars at one time in her life, and her
imagination immediately wandered off into fascinating
vistas, which Jane's prosaic words had thrown
open before her. She heard, as in a dream, the
nasal, incisive voice as it went on with the catalogue
of her possessions.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's worth three thousand dollars, if it's
worth a cent! I heerd Squire Brooks a-tellin' Orthaniel
Stebbins so at the funeral. An' then, here's
the house. There ain't no comfortabler one on
Joneses' Hill, nor one that has more good furnitoor
an' fixin's in it. Then there's Aunt Abigail's clo'es
an' things. Why, ter my <i>sartain</i> knowledge there's
no less'n five real good dresses a-hangin' in the
fore-chamber closet, ter say nothin' of the bureau
full of under-clo'es an' beddin'." Jane did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
think it necessary to explain by what means this
"sartain knowledge" had been achieved, but continued:
"There's a silk warp alpacky now, a-hangin'
up there, why&mdash;it's e'en-a-most as good as
new! The creases ain't out on't." (Unsophisticated
Jane! not to know that the creases never <i>do</i> go
out of alpaca.) "I don't see what in the name
o' sense ye're a-goin' ter dew with all them dresses.
It'll take ye a life-time ter wear 'em out. If <i>I</i> hed
that silk warp alpacky now,"&mdash;she continued musingly,
yet raising her voice so suddenly that Thirza
started; "if <i>I</i> hed that are dress, I should take out
two of the back breadths for an over-skirt&mdash;yes&mdash;an'
<i>gore</i> the others!" This climax was delivered
in triumphant tone. Then lowering her voice she
continued, reflectively: "Aunt Abigail was jest
about my build."</p>

<p>Thirza caught the import of the last words.</p>

<p>"Jane," said she, languidly, with an undertone
of impatience in her voice (it was hard to be recalled
from her pleasant wanderings by a silk warp
alpaca!), "Jane, you can have it."</p>

<p>"Wh&mdash;what d'ye say?" inquired Jane, incredulously.</p>

<p>"I said you could have that dress; I don't want
it," repeated Thirza.</p>

<p>Jane sat a moment in silence before she trusted
herself to speak. Her heart was beating with delight,
but she would not allow the smallest evi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>dence
of joy or gratitude to escape in word or
look.</p>

<p>"Wall," she remarked, coolly, after a fitting
pause, "ef you haint got no use for it, I might take
it, I s'pose. Not that I'm put tew it for clo'es, but
I allers did think a sight of Aunt Abigail&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her remarks were interrupted by an exclamation
from Thirza. The front gate opened with a
squeak and closed with a rattle and bang, and the
tall form of Orthaniel Stebbins was seen coming
up the path. Orthaniel was a mature youth of
thirty. For length and leanness of body, prominence
of elbow and knee joints, size and knobbiness
of extremities, and vacuity of expression,
Orthaniel would have been hard to match. He
was attired in a well-preserved black cloth suit,
with all the usual accessories of a rustic toilet.
His garments seemed to have been designed by
his tailor for the utmost possible display of the
joints above mentioned, and would have suggested
the human form with equal clearness, if buttoned
around one of the sprawling stumps which were so
prominent a feature in the surrounding landscape.
On this particular occasion there was an air of importance,
almost of solemnity, about his person,
which, added to a complacent simper, born of a
sense of the delicate nature of his present errand,
produced in his usually blank countenance something
almost amounting to expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>At first sight of this not unfamiliar apparition,
Thirza had incontinently fled, but Jane received
the visitor with becoming impressiveness.</p>

<p>"Good-evenin', Mr. Stebbins. Walk right into
the fore-room," she remarked, throwing open the
door of that apartment of state.</p>

<p>"No need o' puttin' yourself out, marm; the
settin'-room's good enough for me," graciously responded
the gentleman.</p>

<p>"Walk right in," repeated Jane, throwing open
one shutter, and letting in a dim light upon the
scene&mdash;a veritable chamber of horrors, with its
hideous carpet, hair-cloth chairs and sofa, the nameless
abominations on its walls, and its general air
of protest against the spirit of beauty and all that
goes to make up human comfort.</p>

<p>Mr. Stebbins paused on the threshold. There
was something unusually repellent about the room,
a lingering funereal atmosphere, which reached
even his dull senses. He would have infinitely preferred
the sitting-room; but a latent sense of something
in his errand which required the utmost dignity
in his surroundings prevailed, and he therefore
entered and seated himself on one of the prickly
chairs, which creaked expostulatingly beneath him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;ahem! Is Miss Bradford in?"</p>

<p>This question was, of course, a mere form,&mdash;a
<i>ruse de guerre</i>, as it were,&mdash;and Mr. Stebbins
chuckled inwardly over his remarkable diplomacy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
He had seen Thirza at the window, and witnessed
her sudden flight; but, so far from feeling affronted
by the act, it had rather pleased him. It indicated
maiden shyness, and he accepted it as a flattering
tribute to his powers of fascination. "She's gone
to fix up her hair, or somethin'," he reflected.</p>

<p>When Jane came to summon her, she found
Thirza sitting by the window of the fore-chamber,
gazing thoughtfully out into the twilight again.</p>

<p>"Thirzy!" whispered the spinster, as mysteriously
as if Mr. Stebbins was within possible earshot,
"Orthaniel Stebbins wants ter see yer. Go
right down!"</p>

<p>"Jane, I&mdash;sha'n't!" answered Thirza, shortly.</p>

<p>Jane started, and opened her small gray eyes
their very widest.</p>

<p>"Wh-at?" she stammered.</p>

<p>"I mean I don't want to go down," said Thirza,
more politely. "I don't wish to see him."</p>

<p>"Wall, if that don't beat the master!" exclaimed
Jane, coming nearer. "Why, he's got on
his Sunday clo'es! 'S likely 's not he's a-goin' ter
propose ter ye!"</p>

<p>"You had better send him away, then," said
Thirza.</p>

<p>"Ye don't mean to say ye wouldn't hev him!"
gasped Jane, with a look of incredulous amazement
which, catching Thirza's eye, caused her to
burst into a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose I must go down," she said at last,
rising. "If I don't, I shall have all Jones' Hill
down upon me. Oh dear!"</p>

<p>Mr. Stebbins would have been surprised to see
that she passed the mirror without even one
glance.</p>

<p>"Hadn't ye better take off yer apron, an' put
on a pink bow, or somethin'?" suggested Jane;
"ye look real plain."</p>

<p>Thirza did not deign to reply, but walked indifferently
away.</p>

<p>"Wall!" ejaculated the bewildered spinster, "I
hope I may never!" And then, being a person
who believed in improving one's opportunities, she
proceeded at once to a careful re-examination of
the "silk-warp alpacky," which hung in straight,
solemn folds from a nail in the closet; it had hung
precisely the same upon Aunt Abigail's lathy
form.</p>

<p>Thirza went into the gloomy fore-room. It
struck a chill to her heart, and she went straight
past Mr. Stebbins, with merely a nod and a "good-evening,"
and threw open another shutter, before
seating herself so far from him, and in such a
position, that he could only see her face by an
extraordinary muscular feat. Mr. Stebbins felt
that his reception was not an encouraging one.
He hemmed and hawed, and at last managed to
utter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pleasant evenin', Miss Bradford."</p>

<p>"Very," responded Thirza. It was particularly
cold and disagreeable outside, even for a New
England April.</p>

<p>"I guess we kin begin plantin' by next week,"
continued the gentleman.</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" responded Thirza,
in an absent sort of way.</p>

<p>It was not much; but it was a question, and in
so far helped on the conversation. Mr. Stebbins
was re-assured.</p>

<p>"Yes," he resumed, in an animated manner, "I
actooally dew! Ye see, Miss Bradford, ye haint
said nothin' tew me about the farm, so I thought
I'd come 'roun' an' find out what yer plans is."</p>

<p>"I haven't made any," said Thirza, as he
paused.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ye haint? Well, ye know I've been
a-workin' on't on shares fur yer aunt Abigail,
goin' on five year, an' I'm ready ter dew the same
fur <i>you</i>; that is&mdash;&mdash;" and here Mr. Stebbins
hitched a little nearer, while a smile, which displayed
not only all his teeth, but no little gum as
well, spread itself over his bucolic features, "that
is, if we can't make no other arrangements more
pleasin'."</p>

<p>There was no mistaking his intentions now;
they spoke from every feature of his shrewdly
smiling countenance, from his agitated knees and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
elbows, and from the uneasy hands and feet which
seemed struggling to detach themselves from their
lank continuations and abscond then and there.</p>

<p>Thirza looked her wooer calmly in the face.
Her imperturbability embarrassed but did not dishearten
him.</p>

<p>"Thar ain't no use in foolin' round the stump!"
he continued. "I might jest as well come out
with it, plain an' squar! I'm ready an' willin' to
take the <i>hull</i> farm off yer hands if you're agreeable.
You jest marry me, Thirzy, an' that settles the
hull question slick as a whistle!" and Mr. Stebbins
settled back in his chair with a look as if he
had just elucidated a long-mooted problem in
social science.</p>

<p>Thirza rose: there was a little red spot on each
cheek, and an unwonted sparkle in her soft eyes;
but her manner was otherwise unruffled as she
answered:</p>

<p>"You are really very kind, Mr. Stebbins, but I
think I shall find some other way out of the dilemma.
I couldn't think of troubling <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;&mdash;" he stammered, "'tain't&mdash;no trouble&mdash;at
all!"</p>

<p>But Thirza was gone.</p>

<p>For a moment Mr. Stebbins doubted his identity.
He stared blankly at the open door awhile,
and then his eyes wandered vacantly over the carpet
and wall, finally coming to rest upon the toes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of his substantial boots. He sat for some time
thus, repeating Thirza's words as nearly as he
could recall them, endeavoring to extract the pith
of meaning from the surrounding fibres of polite
language. Had she actually refused him? Mr.
Stebbins, by a long and circuitous mental process,
arrived at length at the conclusion that she <i>had</i>,
and accordingly rose, walked out of the front door
and down the narrow path, in a state of mind best
known to rejected suitors. As he closed the gate
he cast one sheepish look toward the house.</p>

<p>"I'll be darned!" he muttered, "I'll be darned
if I hain't got the mitten!" and, discomfited and
sore, the Adonis of Jones' Hill disappeared in the
evening shadows.</p>

<p>Jane was watching his departure from behind
the curtain of the sitting-room window. In all
probability her gentle bosom had never been the
scene of such a struggle as was now going on beneath
the chaste folds of her striped calico gown.
She could not doubt the object of Mr. Stebbins's
visit, nor its obvious result. Astonishment, incredulity,
curiosity, in turn possessed her.</p>

<p>"Waal!" she soliloquized, as the curtain fell
from her trembling fingers, "the way some folks
fly in the face of Providence doos beat the master!"</p>

<p>Thirza, too, had observed her suitor as he strode
away, with an expression of scorn upon her face
which finally gave way to one of amusement, end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>ing
in a laugh&mdash;a curious hysterical laugh. A moment
later she had thrown herself upon the bed,
and Jane, who in a state of curiosity bordering on
asphyxia, came up to the door soon after, heard a
sound of sobbing, and considerately went away.</p>

<p>Thirza had her cry out; every woman knows
what that means, and knows, too, the mingled
sense of relief and exhaustion which follows. It
was fully an hour later when she arose and groped
her way down into the sitting-room where Jane sat
knitting zealously by the light of a small lamp.
That person's internal struggles commenced afresh,
and a feeling of indignation quite comprehensible
burnt in her much-vexed bosom as Thirza, after
lighting another lamp, bade her "good-night,"
and went out of the room, leaving her cravings for
fuller information unassuaged.</p>

<p>Once more in her room, Thirza seated herself
before the glass and began to loosen the heavy
dark braids of her hair. Upon the bureau lay an
open letter, and leaving the soft tresses half undone,
she took it up and re-read it. When she
had finished she let it fall upon her lap and fell to
thinking. The letter was from her cousin Sue,
and bore a foreign post-mark, and from thinking
over its contents Thirza fell into reflections upon
the diversity of human fate, particularly her own
and Sue's. They had commenced life under very
similar circumstances. Both had been born about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the same time, and in the town of Millburn. Both
were "only" children, the fathers of both were
mechanics of the better class, and the girls were
closely associated up to their fourteenth year, as
play-fellows and school-mates. Sue was an ordinary
sort of a girl, with a rather pretty blonde
face; Thirza, a bright, original creature, with a
mobile, dark face, which almost every one turned
to take a second look at; a girl who, with a book,
almost any book, became oblivious of all else.
Her father was a man of more than ordinary intelligence,
of a dreamy, speculative turn of mind, and
subject to periods of intense depression. When
she was about fourteen years old, Thirza went one
evening to the barn to call her father to supper.
Receiving no answer to her call, she entered, and
there, in a dim corner, she saw <i>something</i> suspended
from a beam,&mdash;something she could never
efface from her memory. A shaft of sunlight full
of dancing motes fell athwart the distorted face,
whose smile she must now forever miss, and across
the rigid hands which would never again stroke
her hair in the old fond, proud way. In that moment
the child became a woman. She went to
the nearest neighbor, and without scream or sob
told what she had seen&mdash;then she went to her
mother. Soon after, the young girl whose school-life
was thus early ended took her place at a loom
in one of the great cotton-mills, and there she re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>mained
for more than ten years, the sole support
and comfort of her weak, complaining mother,
who from the dreadful day that made her a widow,
sank into hopeless invalidism. One year previously
to the commencement of this story she had
been laid to rest. In the meantime Sue had grown
up, and married a "smart fellow," who after a
few years of successful business life in New York,
had been sent by some great firm to take charge
of a branch establishment in Paris.</p>

<p>Thirza was thinking of these things now, as she
sat with Sue's gossipy letter on her lap&mdash;thinking
of them wearily, and even with some bitterness.
It seemed to her hard and strange that Sue should
have everything, and she only her lonely, toilsome
life, and her dreams. These indeed remained; no
one could forbid them to her&mdash;no amount of toil
and constant contact with sordid natures could
despoil her of her one priceless treasure, the power
to live, in imagination, brief but exquisite phases
of existence which no one around her ever suspected.
Books furnished the innocent hasheesh,
which transported her out of the stale atmosphere
of her boarding-house into realms of ever new delight.</p>

<p>But to-night she could not dream. The interview
with Mr. Stebbins had been a rude shock, a
bitter humiliation to her. She had held herself so
proudly aloof from the men of her acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
that none had ever before ventured to cross the
fine line of reserve she had drawn about her; and
now, this uncouth, mercenary clown had dared
pull down the barrier, and trample under foot the
delicate flowers of sentiment she had cherished
with such secrecy and care. Her first wooer! Not
thus, in the idle dreams which come to every
maiden's heart, had Thirza pictured him. That
other rose before her now, and strangely enough,
it took on the semblance, as it often had of late,
of one she had almost daily seen&mdash;a handsome
face, a true and good one, too; and yet the hot
blood surged into her cheeks, and she tried to banish
the image from her mind. It would not go at
her bidding, however, and, as if to hide from her
own eyes in the darkness, Thirza arose and put
out the light.</p>

<p>There was no time for dreaming after this, for
the question of her inheritance must be settled.
So, after a day or two of reflection, Thirza drove
into town and held a long consultation with Squire
Brooks, the result of which was that the farm was
announced for sale. It was not long before a purchaser
appeared, and in due course of time Thirza
found herself, for the first time in her life, in possession
of a bank-book!</p>

<p>She returned to her place in the mill, notwithstanding,
and was secretly edified in observing the
effect which her re-appearance produced upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
operatives. The women watched her askance,
curiously and enviously, indulging in furtive remarks
upon her unchanged appearance. As an
heiress something had evidently been expected of
her in the way of increased elegance in dress, and
its non-appearance excited comment. On the part
of the men there was a slight increase of respect in
their mode of salutation, and in one or two instances,
an endeavor to cultivate a nearer acquaintance,
an endeavor, it is needless to say, without
success.</p>

<p>But if there was no outer change in Thirza, there
was an inner change going on, which became at
length a feverish restlessness, which disturbed her
night and day. She found herself continually taking
down from her shelves certain fascinating
books, treating of foreign scenes and people; reading
and re-reading them, and laying them aside
with strange reluctance. Then she fell into a habit
of taking her little bank-book, and figuring assiduously
upon the covers. Three thousand dollars!
Enough, she bitterly reflected, to keep her from
the almshouse when her hands became too feeble
to tend the loom, but a paltry sum, after all!
Many persons, even in Millburn, spent far more
than that yearly.</p>

<p>All at once a thought flashed upon her, a
thought which took away her breath and set her
brain to whirling. And yet it was not an abso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>lutely
new thought. It had haunted her under
various disguises from the moment when Jane
Withers, by a few words, had transmuted the barren
pastures and piney woods of her farm into
actual dollars; and now, after hovering about all
this time, it had found a moment,&mdash;when some fascinating
book had thrown her off her guard,&mdash;to
spring upon and overpower her. For a moment
she was stunned and overwhelmed&mdash;then she calmly
closed the little bank-book, and said: "I will do
it!"</p>

<p>In one week the whole town knew that Thirza
Bradford was going to travel, and all former discussions
of her affairs sank into nothing in comparison
with the importance they now assumed.
Among her immediate acquaintances there was
considerable excitement, and their opinions were
freely, if not elegantly, expressed. The men, almost
without exception, pronounced her "a fool,"
as did the elder women, whose illusions, if they
had ever entertained any, had long since been dispelled.
But among the younger women there was
a more or less repressed feeling of sympathy,
amounting to envy. Poor girls! they, too, no
doubt, indulged in secret longings which their prosaic
work-a-day world failed to satisfy; and doubtless
those who had themselves "aunt Abigails," or
any other "expectations" of a like nature, were
led into wild and wicked speculations upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
tenure of human life, for which, it is to be hoped,
Thirza will not be held accountable.</p>

<p>It is the fashion of the day to ascribe our more
objectionable peculiarities and predilections to
"hereditary taint," and there is something so comforting
and satisfactory in this theory, that it has
attracted many adherents not otherwise of a scientific
turn of mind. Millburn was not scientific; but
even Millburn fell into the same way of theorizing.</p>

<p>"Bill Bradford," said public opinion, "was an
oneasy sort of a chap,&mdash;a half crazy, extravagant
critter,&mdash;and Thirzy is a chip o' the old block."</p>

<p>When the news reached Jones' Hill,&mdash;which it
shortly did by the never-failing means of Jane
Withers, who was accommodatingly helping Orthaniel's
mother through a course of "soap-bilin',"&mdash;the
comments were severe. Orthaniel received
the tidings as he was about starting for the cow-yard,
with a milk-pail in each hand. He listened,
with fallen jaw, unto the bitter end. Then, giving
his blue overalls an expressive hitch, he remarked
ungallantly:</p>

<p>"That gal hain't got no more sense 'n a yaller
dog!"&mdash;and he, at least, may be pardoned for so
thinking.</p>

<p>As for Thirza, her decision once made, she
troubled herself little about the "speech of
people." From the moment when she had closed
her little bank-book with the words "I will do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
it," she became, not another woman, but her real
self. She went serenely about her simple preparations
for her departure in a state of quiet exultation
which lent a new charm to her dark face and a new
grace to her step.</p>

<p>Squire Brooks arranged her money affairs for
her,&mdash;not without remonstrance, however. It
seemed to the close-fisted, elderly man a wild and
wanton thing to do; but there was something in
the half-repressed enthusiasm of the girl which
caused the wise, prudential words to die upon his
lips. When she left his office, on the evening before
her departure, he watched the light-stepping
figure out of sight, and then walked up to the
dingy office mirror and surveyed his wrinkled visage
on all sides. Carefully brushing up the sparse
gray locks which had been ordered to the front, as
it were, to fill the gaps created by Time's onslaughts,
he shook his head deprecatingly, and
with a sigh walked away from the glass, humming
softly "Mary of Argyle."</p>

<p>As Thirza, absorbed in thought, turned into the
long, shaded street which led down to her boarding-house,
she was startled out of her reverie by
the sound of her own name, pronounced in a
friendly tone. Looking up, she saw a gentleman
approaching. Her heart gave a quick leap as she
recognized Warren Madison, son of the richest
manufacturer of Millburn. He was no recent ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>quaintance.
In her school days, when social distinctions
weighed but little, there had been a
childish intimacy and fondness between them.
Time and separation, and the wide difference in
their position,&mdash;which she, at least, felt most
keenly,&mdash;had estranged them. Since the young
man's return, after years of study and travel, to
become his father's partner, she had met him very
often, both in the mill and outside of it, and he
had constantly shown a disposition to renew their
former friendship. But poor, proud Thirza had
rejected all his advances. Even now, although
her cheeks tingled and her hands trembled nervously,
she would have passed him with a simple
nod; but somehow, before she realized it, young
Madison had secured her hand and a smile, too;
and, to her surprise, she found herself walking by
his side, talking with something of the familiarity
of the old school days.</p>

<p>"I have been absent for some time, and only
heard to-day that you are going away," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," responded Thirza. "I am going away&mdash;to
Europe."</p>

<p>"To seek your fortune?" said he, with a smile.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;to spend it," said Thirza, in the same
manner. "I suppose that you, like Parson Smythers
and the rest of Millburn, consider it an 'ex<i>try-or</i>dinary
proceeding,'"&mdash;this with a fair imitation
of the reverend gentleman's peculiar drawl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Madison smiled.</p>

<p>"Don't count me among your judges, I beg of
you, Thirza," he responded, more gravely. "Perhaps
I understand you better than you think."</p>

<p>She glanced quickly up into his face,&mdash;a handsome
face, frank and noble in its expression.</p>

<p>"Understand me?" she repeated; "I don't
think any one understands me. Not that they are
to blame&mdash;I am hardly worth the trouble, I suppose.
I know," she continued, moved by an impulse
to unburden her heart to some one, "I know
that people are discussing and condemning me,
and it does not trouble me at all to know it; but I
don't mind saying this much <i>to you</i>." She caught
the last two words back between her lips, but not
before they had reached the young man's ears.
He glanced quickly into her downcast face, with a
look full of eager questioning; but this Thirza did
not see, for she had turned her eyes away in confusion.
"You know what my life has been," she
went on impetuously. "I have never had any
youth. Ever since I was a child, I have toiled to
keep body and soul together. I have succeeded
in feeding the one; but the other has starved. I
have weighed everything in the balance. I am all
alone in the world&mdash;all I had to live for is&mdash;up
there." She pointed over her shoulder toward the
old burying-ground. "I may be foolish,&mdash;even
selfish and wicked,&mdash;but I can't help it! I am going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to leave everything behind me, all the work and all
the worry, and give myself a holiday. For one
whole year I am going to <i>live</i>&mdash;really <i>live</i>! After
that, I can bear the old life better&mdash;perhaps!"</p>

<p>The girl was almost beautiful as she spoke, with
the soft fire in her eyes and her cheeks aglow.
Her voice was sweet and full, and vibrated like a
harp-string. The young man beside her did not
look at her. He walked steadily forward, gazing
straight down into the dusty road, and striking
out almost savagely with his cane at the innocent
heads of the white clover which crowded up to the
road-side.</p>

<p>"I think I know how you feel," he said, after a
while. "Why, do you know, I have often had
such thoughts myself. Better one year of real life,
as you say, than a century of dull routine!"</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the door of Thirza's
boarding-house. There were faces at almost every
window of the much-windowed establishment, to
say nothing of those of the neighboring houses;
but neither Thirza nor her companion was aware
of this.</p>

<p>They stood on the steps a moment in silence;
then he held out his hand. As she placed her
own within it, she felt it tremble. Their eyes met,
too, with a swift recognition, and a sharp, sweet
pain went through her heart. She forced herself
to turn her eyes away, and to say quietly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-evening and good-bye, Mr. Madison."</p>

<p>The young man dropped her hand and drew a
quick breath.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Thirza," he said; "may you find it
all that you anticipate. Good-bye."</p>

<p>And the score or more pairs of inquisitive eyes at
the surrounding windows saw young Mr. Madison
walk calmly away, and Miss Bradford, with equal
calmness, enter her boarding-house.</p>

<p>The next morning Thirza went away, and, the
nine days' wonder being over, she was dropped
almost as completely out of the thoughts and conversation
of the people of Millburn as if she had
never existed.</p>

<p>We will not accompany her on her travels.
There was a time when we might have done so;
but alas, for the story-writer of to-day! Picture-galleries,
palaces, and châlets, noble, peasant, and
brigand, gondolas, volcanoes, and glaciers,&mdash;all
are as common and familiar to the reader of the
period as bonbons. It is enough to say that Thirza
wandered now in reality, as she had so often in
fancy, through the storied scenes which had so
charmed her imagination; often doubting if it were
indeed herself, or if what she saw were not the
baseless fabric of a vision, which the clanging of
the factory bell might demolish at any moment.</p>

<p>Sue's astonishment when Thirza, after two
months in England and Scotland, walked one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
into her apartment in Paris, quite unannounced,
can be imagined. She wondered and conjectured,
but, as her unexpected guest was neither awkward
nor badly dressed, accepted the situation gracefully,
and ended by really enjoying it. After delightful
Paris days, came Italy, Germany, and
Switzerland, and then more of Paris, and at last
came a time when inexorable figures showed Thirza
plainly that she must think of returning to America.</p>

<p>"Thirza," protested Sue, "you really <i>mustn't</i>
go."</p>

<p>For answer Thirza held up to view a travel-stained
porte-monnaie.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can arrange it somehow," persisted
her cousin, vaguely. "You might take a situation
as governess, you know;" these words were
uttered doubtfully, and with a deprecating glance
at the face opposite.</p>

<p>"Thank you!" responded Thirza. "I don't
feel a call in that direction. I think, on the whole,
I'd prefer weaving cotton."</p>

<p>"You'll find it unendurable!" groaned Sue.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>que voulez-vous</i>?" responded her cousin,
lightly; a quick ear would have noted the slight
tremor in her voice. "I have had a glorious holiday."</p>

<p>"But the going back will be simply dreadful,"
persisted Sue. "I wish I were rich&mdash;then you
shouldn't go!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hardly think that would make any difference,
my dear cousin. I don't think I am eminently
fitted to become a parasite," laughed Thirza.</p>

<p>"Do you know what you <i>are</i> eminently fitted
for?" cried Sue, energetically.</p>

<p>"Sue!" cried Thirza, warningly.</p>

<p>"I don't care," Sue continued, daringly; "you
are so set on going back to America that I half
suspect&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, Sue, please!" interrupted Thirza, with
such evident signs of genuine displeasure, that Sue,
who stood somewhat in awe of her cousin, ceased
to banter, mentally vowing that she was "the
queerest girl she had ever met with."</p>

<p>Thirza arose and went out into the flower-adorned
balcony. She sought distraction, but
somehow the surging, chattering crowd in the
street below, the brilliant illumination, the far-off
strains of music, did not bring her what she
sought.</p>

<p>"If only Sue wouldn't!" she reflected, and
then, between her and the sea of heads, and the
lights and the flowers rose a face&mdash;the face that
had troubled her meditations on Jones' Hill, that
had followed her in all her wanderings, the noble
face, with its blue eyes bent upon her so earnestly,
so eloquently. Had she read aright, even if too
late, the meaning of those eyes as they met hers
at parting? The same sweet, sharp pain that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
not all pain, shot through her heart, and a consciousness
of something blindly missed, something
perversely thrown away, came over her. Sighing,
she arose, and in response to Sue's call, went in
and dressed for a gay party, in which, in her present
mood, she felt neither pleasure nor interest.
"If people here knew what a pitiful fraud I am&mdash;what
a despicable part I am acting!" she said to
herself, as, well-dressed and handsome, she entered
the brilliant <i>salon</i>.</p>

<p>It was all over in a few days, and Thirza was
sailing homeward as fast as wind and wave and
steam could carry her. The year that had passed
had brought little outward change in the girl. She
looked fairer and fresher, perhaps, and certain little
rusticities of dress and speech and manner had
disappeared&mdash;worn off, as had the marks of toil
from the palms of her slender hands. But to all
intents and purposes, the tall figure in its close-fitting
brown suit, which during the homeward
voyage sat for the most part in the vessel's stern,
gazing back over the foaming path, was the same
which had watched a year before with equal steadiness
from the steamer's bow. The very same, and
yet&mdash;the girl often wondered if she were indeed
the same, and lost herself in speculations as to how
the old life at Millburn would seem to her now.
She recalled with inflexible accuracy the details of
her existence there, and tried to look her future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
undauntedly in the face. But all her philosophy
failed her when in imagination she found herself
upon the threshold of the old mill. There, indeed,
she faltered weakly, and turned back.</p>

<p>When at last, one evening in June, she stepped
out of the train at the little station of Millburn, a
crowd of bitter thoughts came rushing upon her,
as if they had been lying in wait there to welcome
her. She had informed no one of her coming, and
it was not strange that no friendly face greeted
her, and yet, as she pursued her way alone through
the silent, unlighted streets, her heart grew faint
within her. How poor and meagre everything
seemed! The unpaved streets, the plank sidewalks,
the wooden houses, and yonder, across the
river, the great mills, looming grim and shapeless
through the dusk! The long, glorious holiday was
over&mdash;there lay her future.</p>

<p>Weary and sick at heart she entered her boarding-house.
The old familiar aroma saluted her,
the hard-featured landlady welcomed her with a
feeble smile, the unwashed children with noisy
demonstrations.</p>

<p>Her room was at her disposal, and under the
plea of fatigue she kept out of sight the whole of
the succeeding day, which happened to be Sunday.
She lay the greater part of the day upon
the old lounge, looking round upon the well-known
furnishings with a weary gaze. How small and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
shabby the room, how hideous the wall paper,
how mean and prosaic everything, and the very
canaries in their cage had forgotten her, and
screamed shrilly at her approach!</p>

<p>That was a long day&mdash;the longest of her life,
she thought. But the girl was made of good stuff;
she made a brave fight, and this time came off
conqueror. When Monday morning came, she
arose and dressed herself in the old gray working
suit, smiling back encouragement to her reflection
in the glass as if it had been that of another person.
There was no use in putting off the evil day,
she said to herself, it would only make it harder;
and so, when the great bells clanged out their
harsh summons, she went out into the beautiful
June morning, joined the crowd which streamed
across the bridge, and before the last brazen tone
had died away, preliminaries were arranged, and
Thirza was in her old place again.</p>

<p>All through the long summer days Thirza
labored on at the old work, with aching limbs and
throbbing pulses. The unceasing din and jar, the
invisible flying filaments, the hot, oily atmosphere,
the coarse chatter of the operatives, wearied and
sickened her as never before. Every evening she
left the mill with a slower step; deep lines began
to show themselves in her face, heavy shadows to
settle beneath her dark, sad eyes. Poor girl! it
was all so much harder than she had anticipated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
The latent forces in her nature, which, through all
those years of toil, had never been called into
action, were now, since her plunge into another
phase of life, fully aroused, and asserted themselves
in ceaseless clamor against surroundings.
Besides this,&mdash;smother it, fight it, ignore it, as she
might,&mdash;she was living in a state of tremulous expectancy.
Again and again her heart had leaped
at the sight of a figure in the distance, only to
sink again into a dull throb of disappointment.</p>

<p>The fourth Sunday after her return, Thirza went
to church for the first time. It was early when
she arrived and people were just beginning to assemble.
Many greeted her warmly and proffered
her a seat, but she refused all, taking one far back,
and at one side where she could see all who
entered. The seats gradually filled, but it was not
until the last strains of the voluntary were dying
away that Madison, senior, the great manufacturer,
and his large complacent-looking wife came in, and
with an air of filling the whole edifice, marched
down to their pew in the front row. The music
ceased. There was a rustling of silk which was
audible in every part of the little church, and
Warren Madison entered, accompanied by a stately
blonde girl, elegantly attired. Queen-like she
swept along, and Thirza saw, as if in a dream, the
smile which she bestowed upon her escort as he
stood aside to allow her to enter the pew, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
saw also his face, looking handsomer and manlier
than ever. Then they were seated, and only the
backs of their heads were visible. Thirza's heart
stood still for a moment, and then began beating
so wildly that she almost feared those around her
might hear it. She went through mechanically
with the simple forms the service required. She
even tried to follow the thread of the Rev. Mr.
Smyther's labored discourse, but there, between
her and the pulpit, were the nodding white plumes
and the yellow braid, and the brown shapely head
and broad shoulders, and oh! so near together!
Interminable as the service seemed, it came to an
end at last, and before the amen of the benediction
had died upon the air, Thirza was in the street,
hastening homeward.</p>

<p>The next day she stood at her loom, listlessly
watching the shifting cloud-pictures in the midsummer
sky, the glittering river, and the distant
meadows and woods, and wishing herself away
from the noise and the close air, and alone in some
deep nook, where she could hide her face and
think. A loud, confused mingling of voices,
among which a high-pitched, girlish one was most
conspicuous, rose above the clatter of the machinery,
and drew her attention. She turned involuntarily
toward the sound, and as quickly back
again. That one glance had sufficed to show her
Warren Madison, escorting a party of ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
through the mill. The blonde girl was there,
looking, in her white dress, like a freshly-gathered
lily. The party passed near her. She heard young
Madison's voice warning the ladies to keep their
draperies from the machinery; she heard the
girlish voice in laughing answer, and, as they
passed by, the same voice exclaiming, "Why,
Warren, what a nice girl, for a mill-girl! The
dark one, I mean, by the window." Then there
came a little whiff of violet perfume, and they had
gone&mdash;he had gone! And, even in the midst of
her humiliation and anger and self-pity, she could
not but be thankful that he had thus passed her
by, without a word. She could not have borne it&mdash;there.</p>

<p>The machinery roared and clattered and groaned,
the air grew closer and hotter, the silvery clouds
grew denser and blacker, and little puffs of wind
blew in and fanned her feverish temples; and at
last the bell sounded, and she could go. Away!
no matter where, so that she were out of sight of
everything and everybody, so that she could be
alone with her own torn, wrathful, tortured soul.
Straight through the town she went, up the hill
beyond, and into the old burying-ground, where
her parents rested. It was the only place, alas!
where she was sure of being left alone; for there
is no place so given over to loneliness and solitude
as a country grave-yard. Here, among the quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
sleepers, where the grass and brier-roses grew rank
and tall, and undisturbed, except now and then to
make room for a new-comer,&mdash;here she dared look
herself in the face. And oh, the shame and scorn
and loathing which that self-inspection produced!
She threw herself down by the graves,&mdash;her graves,&mdash;and
buried her face upon her arms. She lay
there until shadows gathered about her, so still
that the small brown sparrows hopped fearlessly
across the folds of her dress and nestled in the
grass beside her. At last she started up, and
pressed her hands against her temples.</p>

<p>"I cannot bear it!" she cried aloud. "I thought
I could; but I cannot! I must leave this place&mdash;this
hateful, dreadful place&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Was there a footstep near her in the dry grass,
and was some one standing there in the dusk?
She sprang to her feet and would have fled; but
the figure came rapidly toward her. It was Warren
Madison.</p>

<p>"You must pardon my following you, Thirza,"
he said. "I went to the house, and they told me
you had come up this way. I came after you, because
I have something I must say to you."</p>

<p>It was light enough for Thirza to see that he was
very pale, and that his eyes were fixed eagerly
upon her face. Trembling, bewildered, she made
another attempt to pass him; but he seized her
wrist and detained her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thirza," he cried, "do not run away from me
until you have heard what I have to say. Let
me look in your face, and see if I can find what I
thought I saw there when we parted that evening,
more than a year ago."</p>

<p>He drew her toward him, and compelled her to
meet his gaze. She tried to meet it with coldness
and scorn; but she was weak and unnerved, and
there was such pleading tenderness in his voice!
She trembled, and sought feebly to withdraw her
hand.</p>

<p>"Thirza, won't you listen? I love you! I have
loved you so long&mdash;I never knew it until you went
away; I never knew how much until I saw you to-day.
I did not even know you had returned. Oh,
Thirza, I could not have spoken a word to you before
those people for worlds; but how I longed to
snatch you up in my arms! If you had only looked
at me, proud little statue in a gray dress!"</p>

<p>He compelled her to turn her face toward him.</p>

<p>"Thirza, was I mistaken? No, I was not!"
and his voice was full of exultation. "I see the
same look in your eyes again. You love me, my
darling! There!" he cried, releasing her hands,
"proud, cruel little woman, go! Leave me! Run
away from me! I do not keep you; but, Thirza,
you are mine, for all that!"</p>

<p>Hardly conscious of herself, Thirza stood before
him, making no use of her liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, Thirza," said the shaking, passionate
voice, "leave all the work and all the worry&mdash;your
own words, darling; how often I have thought of
them! Leave it all behind, and come here, to me!"</p>

<p>The clouds had parted, and the stars flamed
out, one after another; and, as they were going
home together through the starlight, the young
man said:</p>

<p>"And did you live the 'real life' you anticipated,
Thirza?"</p>

<p>She raised her shining face to his.</p>

<p>"It has just begun," she said.</p>

<h2 id="MOLLY">MOLLY.</h2></div>


<p>A small clearing on a hillside, sloping up from
the little-traversed mountain-road to the forest,
upon whose edge, in the midst of stunted oaks and
scraggy pines stood a rude cabin, such as one
comes upon here and there in the remote wilds of
West Virginia. The sun, pausing just above the
sharp summit of Pinnacle Mountain, threw slant
rays across the rugged landscape, which spring was
touching up with a thousand soft tints. A great
swelling expanse of green, broken at intervals by
frowning ledges, rolled off to the low-lying purple
mountain ranges, whose summits still swam in sunset
light, while their bases were lost in deepest
shadow. Over all, a universal hush, the hush
which thrills one with a sense of utter isolation and
loneliness.</p>

<p>The man and woman who were seated before the
cabin door hardly perceived these things. What
their eyes saw, doubtless, was the fair promise of
the corn-field which stretched along the road for
some distance, the white cow with her spotted calf,
and the litter of lively pigs which occupied inclosures
near the cabin, and&mdash;the tiny baby, who lay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
blinking and clutching at nothing, across the
woman's lap. She was looking down upon the
child with a smile upon her face. It was a young
and handsome face, but there were shadows in the
dark eyes and around the drooping lids, which the
smile could not chase away&mdash;traces of intense suffering,
strange to see in a face so young.</p>

<p>The man, a young and stalwart fellow, shaggy of
hair and long of limb, had placed himself upon a
log which lay beside the door-step, and was lost in
contemplation of the small atom of embryo manhood
upon which his deep-set blue eyes were fixed.
He had been grappling for three weeks with the
overpowering fact of this child's existence, and
had hardly compassed it yet.</p>

<p>"Lord! Molly," he exclaimed, his face broadening
into a smile, "jess look at him now! Look at
them thar eyes! People says as babies don't know
nuthin'. Durned ef thet thar young un don't look
knowin'er 'n old Jedge Wessminster hisself. Why,
I'm mos' afeared on him sometimes, the way he
eyes me, ez cunnin' like, ez much ez ter say 'I'm
hyar, dad, an' I'm agoin' ter stay, an' you's jess
got ter knuckle right down tew it, dad!' Lord!
look at thet thar now!" And the happy sire took
one of the baby's small wrinkled paws and laid it
across the horny palm of his own big left hand.</p>

<p>"Jess look, Molly! Now you ain't agoin' to
tell me ez thet thar hand is ever agoin' to handle a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
ax or a gun, or&mdash;or&mdash;" pausing for a climax,
"sling down a glass o' whiskey? 'Tain't possible!"</p>

<p>At this juncture, an inquisitive fly lit upon the
small eminence in the centre of the child's visage
destined to do duty as a nose. Hardly had the
venturesome insect settled when, without moving a
muscle of his solemn countenance, that astonishing
infant, with one erratic, back-handed gesture,
brushed him away. The enraptured father burst
into a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>"I tole ye so, Molly! I tole ye so! Babies is
jess a-puttin' on. They knows a heap more'n they
gits credit fur, you bet!"</p>

<p>Something like a smile here distended the child's
uncertain mouth, and something which might be
construed into a wink contracted for an instant his
small right eye, whereupon the ecstatic father
made the welkin ring with loud haw-haws of appreciative
mirth.</p>

<p>Molly laughed too, this time.</p>

<p>"What a man you are, Sandy! I'm glad you
feel so happy, though," she continued, softly,
while a flush rose to her cheek and quickly subsided.
"I ain't been much comp'ny for ye, but I
reckon it'll be different now. Since baby come I
feel better, every way, an' I reckon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly and bent low over the
child.</p>

<p>Sandy had ceased his contemplation of the boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and had listened to his wife's words with a look
of incredulous delight upon his rough but not
uncomely face. It was evidently a new thing for
her to speak so plainly, and her husband was not
unmindful of the effort it must have cost her, nor
ungrateful for the result.</p>

<p>"Don't say no more about it, Molly," he responded,
in evident embarrassment. "Them days
is past an' gone an' furgotten. Leastways, <i>I</i> ain't
agoin' to think no more about 'em. Women is
women, an' hez ter be 'lowed fur. I don't know ez
'twas more'n I cud expect; you a-bein' so porely,
an' the old folks a-dyin', an' you a-takin' on it so
hard. I don't go fur ter say ez I ain't been outed
more'n wunst, but thet's over'n gone; an' now,
Molly," he continued cheerfully, "things is a-lookin'
up. Ez soon ez you're strong ag'in, I
reckon ye'll be all right. The little un'll keep ye
from gittin' lonesome an' down-sperited; now
won't he, Molly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sandy," said the woman earnestly, "I
begin to feel as if I could be happy&mdash;happier than
I ever thought of bein'. I'm goin' to begin a new
life, Sandy. I'm goin' to be a better wife to ye
than&mdash;I <i>have</i> been."</p>

<p>Her voice trembled, and she stopped suddenly
again, turning her face away.</p>

<p>She was a strangely beautiful creature to be the
wife of this brawny mountaineer. There was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
softness in her voice in striking contrast to his own
rough tones, and although the mountain accent
was plainly observable, it was greatly modified.
He, himself, ignorant and unsophisticated, full of
the half-savage impulses and rude virtues of the
region, was quite conscious of the incongruity, and
regarded his wife with something of awe mingled
with his undemonstrative but ardent passion. He
sat thus looking at her now, in a kind of adoring
wonder.</p>

<p>"Waal!" he exclaimed at last, "blest ef I kin
see how I ever spunked up enough fur ter ax ye,
anyhow! Ye see, Molly, I'd allers liked ye&mdash;allers;
long afore ye ever thought o' goin' down to
Richmon'."</p>

<p>The woman moved uneasily, and turned her
eyes away from his eager face; but Sandy failed
to notice this, and went on, with increasing ardor:</p>

<p>"After ye'd gone I missed ye powerful! I used
ter go over the mounting ter ax after ye whenever
I cud git away, an' when they tole me how
ye war enjoyin' yerself down thar, a-arnin' heaps
o' money an' livin' so fine, it mos' set me wild. I
war <i>allers</i> expectin' ter hear ez how ye'd got merried,
an' I kep' a-tellin' myself 'twa'n't no use; but
the more I tole myself, the wuss I got. An' when
you come home, Molly, a-lookin' so white an' mizzable
like, an' everybody said ye'd die, it&mdash;why, it
most killed me out, Molly, 'deed it did, I sw'ar!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Sandy did not often speak of those days of his
probation; but, finding Molly in a softened mood,&mdash;Molly,
who had always been so cold and reticent,
so full of moods and fancies,&mdash;he felt emboldened
to proceed.</p>

<p>"Lord, Molly, I didn't hev no rest night <i>nor</i>
day! Bob'll tell ye how I hung around, an' hung
around; an' when ye got a little better an' come out,
a-lookin' so white an' peakèd, I war all of a trimble.
I don't know now how I ever up an' axed ye. I reckon
I never <i>would</i> a-done it ef it hadn't been fur Bob.
He put me up tew it. Sez Bob, 'Marm's afeard as
Molly'll go back to Richmon' ag'in,' an' that war
more'n I <i>could</i> stand; an' so I axed ye, Molly."</p>

<p>Sandy's face was not one adapted to the expression
of tender emotion, but there was a perceptible
mellowing of the irregular features and rough
voice as he went on.</p>

<p>"I axed ye, Molly, and ye said 'Yes'; an' I
ain't never hed no call to be sorry ez I axed ye,
an' I hope you ain't, nuther&mdash;say, Molly?" and the
great hand was laid tenderly on her arm.</p>

<p>"No, Sandy," said she, "I ain't had no call to
be sorry. You've been good to me; a heap better'n
I have been to you."</p>

<p>Truly, Molly <i>was</i> softening. Sandy could hardly
credit his own happiness. He ran his fingers
through the tawny fringe of his beard awhile before
he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thet's all right, Molly. I laid out to be good
to ye, an' I've tried to be. Say, Molly," he continued,
with a kind of pleading earnestness in his
voice, "ye've done hankerin' arter the city, ain't
ye? Kind o' gittin' used to the mountings ag'in,
ain't ye, Molly?"</p>

<p>It was quite dark on the little hillside now, and
Molly could turn her face boldly toward her husband.</p>

<p>"What makes ye keep a-harpin' on that, Sandy?
I ain't hankered after the city&mdash;not for a long time,"
and a slight shudder ran over her. "Just put that
idea out of your head, Sandy. Nothin' could ever
tempt <i>me</i> to go to the city again. I <i>hate</i> it!"</p>

<p>She spoke with fierce emphasis, and rose to go
in. Sandy, somewhat puzzled by her manner, but
re-assured by her words, heaved a sigh and rose
also.</p>

<p>The stars were out, and from a little patch of
swamp at the foot of the hill came the shrill piping
of innumerable frogs, and a whip-poor-will's wild,
sad cry pierced the silence. The baby had long
since fallen asleep. The mother laid him in his
cradle, and night and rest settled down over the
little cabin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Spring had brightened into summer, and summer
was already on the wane; an August morning had
dawned over the mountains. Although the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
shone warmly down upon the dew-drenched earth,
the air was still deliciously cool and fresh.</p>

<p>Molly stood in the door-way, holding in her arms
the baby, whose look of preternatural wisdom had
merged itself into one of infantile softness and benignity.
She was holding him up for the benefit
of Sandy, who, as he went down the red, dusty
road, driving the white cow before him, turned now
and then to bestow a grimace upon his son and
heir. That small personage's existence, while perhaps
less a matter of astonishment to his father than
formerly, had lost none of the charms of novelty.
He was a fine, robust little man, and cooed and
chuckled rapturously in his mother's arms, stretching
out his hands toward the scarlet blossoms of
the trumpet-vine which climbed around the door-way.
Mother and child made a fair picture in the
twining green frame touched up with flame-like
clusters of bloom&mdash;a picture which was not lost
upon Sandy, who, as he passed out of sight of the
cabin, shook his head, and said to himself again,
as he had many and many a time before:</p>

<p>"Blest ef I see how I ever got up spunk enough
to ax her!"</p>

<p>Molly watched her husband out of sight, and
then let her eyes wander over the summer landscape.
There was a look of deep content in her
face, which was no longer pale and worn. The
traces of struggle and suffering had disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
The past may have had its anguish, and its sins
perhaps, but the present must have seemed peaceful
and secure, for she turned from the door-way
with a song upon her lips,&mdash;a song which lingered
all the morning as she went in and out about her
household tasks, trying to make more trim and
bright that which was already the perfection of
trimness and brightness. When she had finished
her work the morning was far advanced and the
sun glared hotly in at the door and window.</p>

<p>She had rocked the baby to sleep, and came out
of the inner room with the happy mother-look
upon her face. She turned to look back, to see,
perhaps, if the fly-net were drawn carefully enough
over the little sleeper. As she stood thus she was
conscious of a human shadow which fell through
the outer door and blotted out the square of sunshine
which lay across the floor, and a deep voice
said:</p>

<p>"I'd thank you for a drink of water, ma'am."</p>

<p>Molly turned quickly and the eyes of the two
met. Over the man's face came a look of utter
amazement which ended in an evil smile.</p>

<p>Over the woman's face came a change so sudden,
so terrible, that the new-comer, base and
hardened as he looked, seemed struck by it, and
the cruel smile subsided a little as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Molly Craigie, by all that's holy!"</p>

<p>The woman did not seem to hear him. She stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
staring at him with wild incredulous eyes and parted
lips, from which came in a husky whisper the words:</p>

<p>"Dick Staples!"</p>

<p>Then she struck the palms of her hands together,
and with a sharp cry sank into a chair. The man
stepped across the threshold, and stood in the centre
of the room looking curiously about him. He
was a large, powerfully built fellow, and, in a certain
way, a handsome one. He was attired in a
kind of hunting costume which he wore with a
jaunty, theatrical air.</p>

<p>"I swear!" he exclaimed, with a brutal laugh, as
his eyes took in the details of the neat little kitchen,
and came at last to rest upon the woman's white
face. "I swear! I do believe Molly's married!"</p>

<p>The idea seemed to strike him as a peculiarly
novel and amusing one.</p>

<p>"Molly Craigie married and settled down!
Well, if that <i>ain't</i> a good one!" and he burst into
another cruel laugh. His mocking words seemed
at last to sting the woman, who had sat smitten mute
before him, into action. She rose and faced him,
trembling, but defiant.</p>

<p>"Dick Staples, what <i>brought</i> ye here only God
knows, but ye mus'n't <i>stay</i> here. Ye must go 'way
this minute, d'ye hear? <i>Ye must go 'way!</i>"</p>

<p>She spoke hurriedly, glancing down the road as
she did so. The man stared blankly at her a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, now, if that ain't a nice way to treat an
old friend! Why, Molly, you ain't going back on
Dick you ain't seen for so long, are you? I'd no
idea of ever seeing <i>you</i> again, but now I've found
you, you don't get rid of me so easy. I'm going
to make myself at home, Molly, see if I don't."
And the man seated himself and crossed his legs
comfortably, looking about him with a mocking air
of geniality and friendliness. "Why, d&mdash;&mdash;n it!"
he continued, "I'm going to stay to dinner, and
be introduced to your husband!"</p>

<p>Molly went nearer to him; the defiance in her
manner had disappeared, and a look of almost abject
terror and appeal had taken its place.</p>

<p>"Dick," she cried, imploringly, "oh, Dick, for
God's sake hear me! If ye want to see me, to
speak with me, I won't refuse ye, only not here,
Dick,&mdash;for God's sake <i>not</i> here!" and she glanced
desperately around. "What brought ye here,
Dick? Tell me that, and where are ye stayin'?"</p>

<p>"Well, then," he answered surlily, "I ran up for
a little shooting, and I'm staying at Digby's."</p>

<p>"At Digby's! That's three miles below here."
She spoke eagerly. "Dick, you noticed the little
meetin'-house just below here in the hollow?"</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>"If ye'll go away now, Dick, right away, I'll
meet ye in the woods. Follow the path that leads
up behind the meetin'-house to-morrow mornin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
between ten and eleven an' I'll meet ye there, but
oh, Dick, for God's sake go away now, before&mdash;before
<i>he</i> comes!"</p>

<p>The desperation in her voice and looks produced
some effect upon the man apparently, for he rose
and said:</p>

<p>"Well, Molly, as you're so particular, I'll do as
you say; but mind now, don't you play me no
tricks. If you ain't <i>there</i>, punctual, I'll be <i>here</i>;
now see if I don't, my beauty." He would have
flung his arms about her, but she started back with
flaming eyes.</p>

<p>"None o' that, Dick Staples!" she cried,
fiercely.</p>

<p>"Spunky as ever, and twice as handsome, I
swear!" exclaimed the fellow, gazing admiringly
at her.</p>

<p>"<i>Are ye goin'?</i>"</p>

<p>There was something in her voice and mien which
compelled obedience, and the man prepared to go.
Outside the door he slung his rifle over his shoulder,
and looking back, said:</p>

<p>"Remember now, Molly, 'Meet me in the willow
glen,' you know. Punctual's the word!" and with
a meaning smile he sauntered down the slope,
humming a popular melody as he went.</p>

<p>The woman stood for a time as he had left her,
her arms hanging by her side, her eyes fixed upon
the door-way. The baby slept peacefully on, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
outside the birds were twittering and calling, and
the breeze tossed the vine-tendrils in at the door
and window, throwing graceful, dancing shadows
over the floor and across her white face and nerveless
hands. A whistle, clear and cheery, came
piping through the sultry noontide stillness. It
pierced her deadened senses, and she started, passing
her hand across her eyes.</p>

<p>"God!"</p>

<p>That was all she said. Then she began laying
the table and preparing the midday meal. When
Sandy reached the cabin she was moving about
with nervous haste, her eyes gleaming strangely
and a red spot on either cheek. Her husband's
eyes followed her wonderingly. The child awoke
and she went to bring him.</p>

<p>"I wonder what's up now?" he muttered, combing
his beard with his fingers, as he was wont to
do when perplexed or embarrassed. "Women <i>is</i>
cur'us! They's no two ways about it, they <i>is</i> cur'us!
They's no 'countin' fur 'em no how, 'deed they ain't!"</p>

<p>At this point the baby appeared, and after his
usual frolic with him, during which he did not
cease his furtive study of Molly's face, Sandy
shouldered his hoe and started for the field. As
he reached the door he turned and said:</p>

<p>"O Molly, I seen a man agoin' across the road
down by the crick; one o' them city fellers, rigged
out in huntin' traps. Did ye see him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly was standing with her back toward her
husband putting away the remains of the meal.</p>

<p>"A man like that came to the door an' asked
for a drink," she answered, quietly.</p>

<p>"He warn't sassy nor nothin'?" inquired Sandy,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;he wasn't sassy," was the answer.</p>

<p>Sandy breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Them city fellers is mighty apt to be sassy,
and this time o' year they'se allers prowlin' 'round,"
and bestowing another rough caress on the baby
he went his way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That evening as they sat together before the
door Sandy said:</p>

<p>"O Molly, I'm agoin' over ter Jim Barker's by
sun-up ter-morrer, ter help him out with his hoein'.
Ye won't be lonesome nor nothin'?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I reckon not," replied his wife. "'Twon't
be the first time I've been here alone."</p>

<p>Involuntarily the eyes of the husband and wife
met, in his furtive questioning look which she met
with a steady gaze. In the dusky twilight her face
showed pale as marble and her throat pulsated
strangely. The man turned his eyes away; there
was something in that face which he could not
bear.</p>

<p>And at "sun-up" Sandy departed.</p>

<p>Molly went about her work as usual. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
was forgotten, nothing neglected. The two small
rooms shone with neatness and comfort, and at
last the child slept.</p>

<p>The hour for her meeting with Staples had arrived,
and Molly came out and closed the cabin
door behind her&mdash;but here her feet faltered, and
she paused. With her hands pressed tightly on her
heart she stood there for a moment with the bright
August sunshine falling over her; then she turned
and re-entered the cabin, went noiselessly into the
bedroom and knelt down by the sleeping child.
One warm, languid little hand drooped over the
cradle's edge. As her eyes fell upon it a quiver
passed over the woman's white face, and she laid
her cheek softly against it, her lips moving the
while.</p>

<p>Then she arose and went away. Down the
dusty road, with rapid, unfaltering steps and eyes
that looked straight before her, she passed and disappeared
in the shadow of the forest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Sandy came home at night he found his wife
standing in the door-way, her dark braids falling
over her shoulders, her cheeks burning, her eyes
full of a fire which kindled his own slow, but ardent,
nature. He had never seen her looking so beautiful,
and he came on toward her with quickened steps
and a glad look in his face.</p>

<p>"Here, Molly," said he, holding up to her face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a bunch of dazzling cardinal-flowers, "I pulled
these fur ye, down in the gorge."</p>

<p>She shrank from the vivid, blood-red blossoms
as if he had struck her, and her face turned ashy
white.</p>

<p>"In the gorge!" she repeated hoarsely&mdash;"in
the gorge! Throw them away! throw them away!"
and she cowered down upon the door-stone, hiding
her face upon her knees. Her husband stared at
her a moment, hurt and bewildered; then, throwing
the flowers far down the slope, he went past her
into the house.</p>

<p>"Molly's gittin on her spells ag'in," he muttered.
"Lord, Lord, I war in hopes ez she war over 'em
fur good!"</p>

<p>Experience having taught him to leave her to
herself at such times, he said nothing now, but sat
with the child upon his lap, looking at her from
time to time with a patient, wistful look. At last
the gloom and silence were more than he could
bear.</p>

<p>"Molly," said he softly, "what ails ye?"</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice she started and rose.
Going to him, she took the child and went out of
the room. As she did so, Sandy noticed that a
portion of her dress was torn away. He remarked
it with wonder, as well as her disordered hair. It
was not like Molly at all; but he said nothing, putting
this unusual negligence down to that general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
"cur'usness" of womankind which was past finding
out.</p>

<p>The next day and the next passed away. Sandy
went in and out, silent and unobtrusive, but with
his heart full of sickening fears. A half-formed
doubt of his wife's sanity&mdash;a doubt which her
strange, fitful conduct during these days, and her
wild and haggard looks only served to confirm&mdash;haunted
him persistently. He could not work,
but wandered about, restless and unhappy beyond
measure.</p>

<p>On the third day, as he sat, moody and wretched,
upon the fence of the corn-field, Jim Barker, his
neighbor from the other side of the mountain, came
along, and asked Sandy to join him on a hunting
excursion. He snatched at the idea, hoping to escape
for a time from the insupportable thoughts he
could not banish, and went up to the cabin for his
gun. As he took it down, Molly's eyes followed
him.</p>

<p>"Where are ye goin', Sandy?" she asked.</p>

<p>"With Jim, fur a little shootin'," was the answer;
"ye don't mind, Molly?"</p>

<p>She came to him and laid her head upon his
shoulder, and, as he looked down upon her face,
he was newly startled at its pinched and sunken
aspect.</p>

<p>"No, Sandy, I don't mind," she said, with the
old gentleness in her tones. She returned his ca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>ress,
clinging to his neck, and with reluctance letting
him go. He remembered this in after times,
and even now it moved him strangely, and he
turned more than once to look back upon the slender
figure, which stood watching him until he
joined his companion and passed out of sight.</p>

<p>An impulse she could not resist compelled her
gaze to follow them&mdash;to leap beyond them, till it
rested upon the Devil's Ledge, a huge mass of
rocks which frowned above the gorge. Along
these rocks, at intervals, towered great pines,
weather-beaten, lightning-stricken, stretching out
giant arms, which seemed to beckon, and point
down the sheer sides of the precipice into the abyss
at its foot, where a flock of buzzards wheeled
slowly and heavily about. The woman's very lips
grew white as she looked, and she turned shuddering
away, only to return, again and again, as the
slow hours lagged and lingered. The sunshine
crept across the floor never so slowly, and passed
at length away; and, just as the sun was setting,
Sandy's tall form appeared, coming up the slope.
Against the red sky his face stood out, white,
rigid, terrible. It was not her husband; it was
Fate, advancing. The woman tried to smile. Poor
mockery of a smile, it died upon her lips. The
whole landscape&mdash;the green forests, purple hills
and gray rocks&mdash;swam before her eyes in a lurid
mist; only the face of her husband&mdash;that was dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>tinct
with an awful distinctness. On he came, and
stood before her. He leaned his gun against the
side of the cabin, and placed the hand which had
held it upon the lintel over her head; the other
was in his breast. There was a terrible deliberation
in all his movements, and he breathed heavily
and painfully. It seemed to her an eternity that
he stood thus, looking down upon her. Then he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Thar's a dead man&mdash;over thar&mdash;under the
ledge!"</p>

<p>The woman neither moved nor spoke. He drew
his hand from his breast and held something toward
her; it was the missing fragment torn from her
dress.</p>

<p>"This yer war in his hand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a wild cry the woman threw herself forward,
and wound her arms about her husband's
knees.</p>

<p>"I didn't go for to do it!" she gasped; "'fore
God I didn't!"</p>

<p>Sandy tore himself away from her clinging arms,
and she fell prostrate. He looked at her fiercely
and coldly.</p>

<p>"Take your hands off me!" he cried. "Don't
tech me! Thar's thet ez mus' be made cl'ar between
you an' me, woman,&mdash;cl'ar ez daylight.
Ye've deceived me an' lied to me all along, but ye
won't lie to me <i>now</i>. 'Tain't the dead man ez<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
troubles me," he went on grimly, setting his teeth,
"'tain't him ez troubles me. I'd 'a' hed to kill him
myself afore I'd done with him mos' likely&mdash;ef <i>you</i>
hadn't. 'Tain't that ez troubles me&mdash;<i>it's what went
afore</i>! D'ye hear? Thet's what I want ter know
an' all I want ter know."</p>

<p>He lifted her up and seated himself before her,
a look of savage determination on his face.</p>

<p>"Will ye tell me?"</p>

<p>The woman buried her face upon her arms and
rocked backward and forward.</p>

<p>"How <i>can</i> I tell ye,&mdash;O Sandy, how <i>can</i> I?"
she moaned.</p>

<p>"Ye kin tell me in one word," said her husband.
"When ye come back from Richmon' thar wuz
them ez tole tales on ye. I hearn 'em, but I didn't
believe 'em&mdash;I <i>wouldn't</i> believe 'em! Now ye've
only ter answer me one question&mdash;wur what they
said <i>true</i>?"</p>

<p>He strove to speak calmly, but the passion within
him burst all bounds; the words ended in a cry of
rage, and he seized her arm with a grip of iron.</p>

<p>"Answer me, answer me!" he cried, tightening
his hold upon her arm.</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> true, oh my God, it <i>was</i> true!"</p>

<p>He loosened his grasp and she fell insensible at
his feet.</p>

<p>There was neither tenderness nor pity in his face
as he raised her, and carrying her in, laid her upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the bed. Without a glance at the sleeping child
he went out again into the gathering darkness.</p>

<p>Far into the night he was still sitting there unconscious
of the passing hours or the chilliness of
the air. His mind wandered in a wild chaos. Over
and over again he rehearsed the circumstances attending
the finding of the dead man beneath the
ledge, and the discovery of the fragment of a
woman's dress in the rigid fingers; his horror when
he recognized the man as the one he had seen
crossing the road near the cabin, and the fragment
as a part of Molly's dress. He had secured this
and secreted it in his bosom before his companion,
summoned by his shouts, had come up. He knew
the pattern too well&mdash;he had selected it himself
after much consideration. True, another might
have worn the same, but the recollection of Molly's
torn dress arose to banish every doubt. There was
mystery and crime and horror, and Molly was behind
it all&mdash;Molly, the wife he had trusted, the
mother of his child!</p>

<p>It must have been long past midnight when a
hand was laid upon his shoulder and his wife's
voice broke the stillness.</p>

<p>"Sandy," said she, "I've come&mdash;to tell ye all.
Ye <i>won't</i> refuse to listen?"</p>

<p>He shivered beneath her touch but did not answer,
and there in the merciful darkness which hid
their faces from each other, Molly told her story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
from beginning to end, told it in a torrent of passionate
words, broken by sobs and groans which
shook her from head to foot.</p>

<p>"I met him in the woods," she went on. "I
took him to the ledge, because I knew nobody
would see us there, an' then I told him everything.
I went down on my <i>knees</i> to him an' begged of
him to go away an' leave me; for I couldn't bear
to&mdash;to give ye up, an' I knew 'twould come to that!
I begged an' I prayed an' he wouldn't hear; an'
then&mdash;an' then&mdash;" she sobbed, "he threatened me,
Sandy, he threatened to go an' tell you all. He
put his wicked face close up to mine, I pushed him
away an' he fell&mdash;he fell, Sandy, but God knows I
didn't go fur to do it."</p>

<p>She stopped, her voice utterly choked with
agonizing sobs, but the man before her did not
move or speak. She threw herself down and
clasped her arms about him.</p>

<p>"Sandy! husband!" she cried. "Do what ye
please with me&mdash;drive me away&mdash;<i>kill</i> me, but remember
this&mdash;I <i>did</i> love ye true an' faithful&mdash;say
ye believe that!"</p>

<p>The man freed himself roughly from her arms.</p>

<p>"I do believe ye," he answered.</p>

<p>There was something horrible in his fierce repulsion
of her touch, in the harsh coldness of his
voice, and the woman shrank back and crouched
at his feet, and neither spoke nor moved again until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
with the first twitter of the birds, the baby's voice
mingling, the mother rose instinctively to answer
the feeble summons. She was chilled to the marrow,
and her hair and garments were wet with the
heavy dew. Sandy sat with averted head buried
in his hands. She longed to go to him, but she
dared not, and she went in to the child. Weak
and unnerved as she was, the heat of the room
overcame her, and sitting there with the baby on
her lap she fell into a deep, death-like slumber.
She returned to consciousness to find herself lying
upon the bed with the child by her side. Some
one had laid her there, and drawn the green shade
close to shut out the bright light. She started up
and listened; there was no sound but the whir of
insects and the warbling of birds. She arose, stiff
and bewildered, and staggered to the door. Sandy
was gone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The day dragged its mournful length along and as
night fell steps were heard approaching. Molly's
heart gave a great leap, but it was not her husband's
step&mdash;it was that of Bob, her brother, who came
slowly up the path, a serious expression on his boyish
face. She would have flown to meet him, but
she could not stir. Her eyes fastened themselves
upon him with a look that demanded everything.</p>

<p>The young fellow came close up to his sister
before speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"How d'ye, Molly, how d'ye?" he said, seating
himself beside her and glancing curiously at
her white, desperate face.</p>

<p>"What is it, Bob?" she gasped; "what is it?
Ye can tell me&mdash;I can bear it."</p>

<p>"I ain't got nothin' much to tell," he answered
with a troubled air. "I war thinkin' ez you
mought hev somethin' ter tell me. Sandy he
come by an' said as how he mus' go down ter
Gordonsville, he an' Jim Barker, on account o' the
man ez fell over the ledge."</p>

<p>The shudder which passed through the woman's
frame escaped Bob's notice, and he continued:</p>

<p>"He said ez how he mus' stay till th' inquist war
over, an' moughtn't be back for a day or two, an'
axed me fur ter keep ye comp'ny till he comes
back."</p>

<p>"Till he comes back!" she repeated in a
whisper.</p>

<p>She hid her face in her hands, and Bob, who,
like Sandy, was used to Molly's strange ways, did
not question her further.</p>

<p>Days, weeks and months passed away, and Sandy
King had not returned. Jim Barker, who had seen
him last, knew only that he had expressed an intention
to remain a few days longer in the town,
and all further inquiries revealed nothing more.</p>

<p>Bob remained with his sister, and, after the first
few weeks of excitement, settled quietly down in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
charge of the little farm,&mdash;"until Sandy gits
back," as he always took pains to declare.</p>

<p>This stoutly maintained contingency was regarded
by the scattered inhabitants of that region
with doubt and disbelief. Sandy's mysterious disappearance
excited much comment, and gave rise
to endless rumors and conjectures. The current
belief, however, was, that being himself a man of
peaceable habits, he had found his wife's temper
too "cantankerous," and had gone in search of the
peace denied him beneath his own roof, such an
event having occurred more than once within the
memory of the oldest inhabitant.</p>

<p>Molly knew nothing of all this. She never left
her own door from the day of her husband's
departure, and Bob,&mdash;warm-hearted fellow,&mdash;had
stood valiantly between his sister and the prying
eyes and sharp tongues which sought to pluck out
the heart of her mystery, or apply venom to her
bleeding wounds.</p>

<p>That something very serious had occurred, he,
more than any other, had cause to suspect, but he
respected his sister's reticence, and watched with
secret pain and anxiety her increasing pallor and
weakness. The hopes he had at first cherished of
Sandy's return died slowly out, but he hardly confessed
it, even to himself.</p>

<p>Autumn passed into winter, and winter into
spring, and in the meantime, as Molly faded, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
little boy thrived and waxed strong. He could
now toddle about on his sturdy legs, and his
prattle and laughter filled the lonely cabin. His
mother watched his development eagerly.</p>

<p>"See, Bob!" she would say, "see how he
walks, an' how plain he can talk! What'll Sandy
say when he sees him?"</p>

<p>Then she would hold up before the round
baby-eyes a distorted, shaggy likeness of Sandy,
which he had once exhibited with great pride on
his return from Gordonsville, and try to teach the
baby lips to pronounce "Dad-dy."</p>

<p>"He'll know him when he comes, Bob, see if he
don't. He'll know his own daddy, won't he,
precious man? An' he'll be here by corn-plantin',
Bob, sure!"</p>

<p>And Bob, who always entered with a great assumption
of cheerfulness into all her plans, would
turn away with a sinking heart.</p>

<p>"Ef he's ever a-comin'," he would say to himself,
"he'd better come mighty soon, or&mdash;&mdash;" and
then something would rise in his throat, and he
could never finish the sentence.</p>

<p>The gray-brown woods had changed to tender
green and purple, the air teemed with the sounds,
and the earth with the tints, of early spring. The
corn was not only planted, but was already sending
up sharp yellow-green spikes out of the soft red
loam, and yet Sandy had not returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>A strange woman had taken Molly's place in the
household, for Molly could no longer go about&mdash;could
hardly sit at the window, looking down the
lonely road or over the distant hills with her eager,
hollow eyes. She had never complained, and up
to this time had refused to see a physician. And
now when one was summoned, he only shook his
head in response to Bob's questions, and hinted
vaguely at mental causes beyond his reach.</p>

<p>She lay for the most part with closed eyes, and
but for the heaving of her breast, one might have
believed her no longer of the living, so white and
shadow-like had she become. She seldom spoke,
but not a night fell, that she did not call Bob
to her side and whisper, with upturned, anxious
eyes:</p>

<p>"I reckon he'll come to-morrow, don't you?"</p>

<p>One evening, after a restless, feverish day, she
woke from a brief nap. Her brother was seated
by her side, looking sadly into her waxen face.
She started up with a strange glitter in her eyes,
and seized his arm.</p>

<p>"Bob," she whispered, "he's comin'! He's
most here! Go and meet him quick, Bob, an' tell
him to hurry, to <i>hurry</i>, mind, or I sha'n't be
here!"</p>

<p>The wildness in her face and voice deepened.</p>

<p>"Go, I tell you! Quick! He's comin'!" and
she would have sprung from the bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, there, Molly," said her brother, soothingly,
"jess lay right down an' be quiet, an' I'll
go."</p>

<p>She lay upon the pillow as he placed her, panting
and trembling, and he went hastily out, pausing,
as he went through the kitchen, to say a few
words to the woman who sat at the table, feeding
the little boy.</p>

<p>"She's a heap wusser," he said, "an' out of her
head. Keep a watch over her while I go for the
doctor."</p>

<p>He ran quickly down the slope toward the field
where the horse was tethered. As he reached the
road he saw a tall form advancing through the
dusk with rapid strides. Something in the gait
and outline set his heart to throbbing; he stopped
and waited. The man came nearer.</p>

<p>"Bob!"</p>

<p>"Sandy!"</p>

<p>The two men clasped hands.</p>

<p>"Molly?" said her husband, brokenly. For
answer Bob pointed silently toward the cabin,
and Sandy passed up the slope before him. As
he entered the little kitchen the child stopped
eating and stared with wide-open eyes at the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Dad-dy! dad-dy!" he babbled.</p>

<p>Sandy saw and heard nothing, but went blindly
on into the inner room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a glad cry, and Molly was in her
husband's arms.</p>

<p>"I knew ye'd come!" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, darlin', I've come, an' I'll never&mdash;&mdash;"
The words died upon his lips, for something in the
face upon his breast told him that Molly was listening
to another voice than his.</p>

<h2 id="DIVERSION">A SUMMER'S DIVERSION.</h2></div>


<p>"For one, <i>I</i> don't trust them yaller-haired,
smooth-spoke women! I never see one on 'em yet
that wa'n't full o' Satan."</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Rhoda Squires who uttered the
above words; and she uttered them with considerable
unnecessary clatter of the dishes she was engaged
in washing. Abby Ann, a lank, dyspeptic-looking
girl of fifteen or sixteen, was wiping the
same, while the farmer himself was putting the finishing
touches to his evening toilet. That toilet
consisted, as usual, of a good wash at the pump,
the turning down of his shirt-sleeves, and a brief
application of the family comb, which occupied a
convenient wall-pocket at one side of the small
kitchen mirror&mdash;after which the worthy farmer considered
himself in full dress, and ready for any
social emergency likely to occur at Higgins' Four
Corners.</p>

<p>"No," said Abby Ann, in response to her
mother's remark, "she ain't no beauty, but her
clo'es does fit elegant. I wish I hed the pattern
o' that white polonay o' hern, but I wouldn't <i>ask</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
her for it&mdash;no, not to save her!" she added, in
praiseworthy emulation of the maternal spirit.</p>

<p>"Oh, you women folks!" interposed the farmer.
"You're as full of envy 'n' backbitin' as a beechnut's
full o' meat. Beauty! Ye don't know what
beauty means. I tell you she <i>is</i> a beauty,&mdash;a real
high-steppin' out-an'-out beauty!"</p>

<p>"She's as old as I be, every bit!" snapped Mrs.
Squires. "An' she hain't got a speck o' color in
her cheeks&mdash;an' she's a widder at that!"</p>

<p>Farmer Squires turned slowly around and deliberately
surveyed the wiry, stooping figure of his
wife from the small, rusty "pug" which adorned
the back of her aggressive little head, and the
sharp, energetically moving elbows, down to the
hem of her stiffly starched calico gown.</p>

<p>"Look-a-here, Rhody," said he, a quizzical look
on his shrewd, freckled countenance, "you've seen
Gil Simmonses thorough-bred? Wall&mdash;that mare
is nigh onto two year older'n our old Sal, but I
swanny&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the red signal which flamed from
Mrs. Squires's sallow cheeks warned her husband
that he had said more than enough, for he came to a
sudden pause, seized upon a pair of colossal cowhide
shoes, upon which he had just bestowed an
unusual degree of attention in the way of polish,
and disappeared in the direction of the barn.</p>

<p>"He's jist as big a fool as ever!" she ejacu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>lated.
"The Lord knows <i>I</i> didn't want no city
folks a-wearin' out <i>my</i> carpets, an' a drinkin' up
<i>my</i> cream, an' a-turnin' up their noses at <i>me</i>! But
no&mdash;ever sence he heared that Deacon Fogg made
nigh onto a hundred dollars last year a-keepin'
summer-boarders, his fingers has been a-itchin' an'
his mouth a-waterin', an' nothin' for't but I must
slave myself to death the whole summer for a pack
o' stuck-up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused&mdash;for a soft rustle of garments and a
faint perfume filled the kitchen, and turning, Mrs.
Squires beheld the object of her vituperation
standing before her.</p>

<p>She was certainly yellow-haired, and though not
"every bit as old" as her hostess, a woman whose
first youth was past; yet so far as delicately turned
outlines, and pearly fairness of skin go, she might
have been twenty. The eyes which met Mrs.
Squires's own pale orbs were of an intense, yet
soft, black, heavy-lidded and languid, and looked
out from beneath their golden fringes with a calm,
slow gaze, as if it were hardly worth their while
to look at all. A smile, purely conventional, yet
sweet with the graciousness of good breeding,
parted the fine, soft lips.</p>

<p>Her mere presence made the room seem small
and mean, and Mrs. Squires, into whose soured
and jealous nature the aspect of beauty and
grace ate like a sharp acid, smarted under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
freshly awakened sense of her own physical insignificance.</p>

<p>She received her guest with a kind of defiant insolence,
which could not, however, conceal her
evident embarrassment, while Abby Ann retreated
ignominiously behind the pantry door.</p>

<p>"I came to ask if Mr. Squires succeeded in
finding some one to take us about," said the lady.
"He thought he could."</p>

<p>Her voice was deep-toned and sweet, her
manner conciliatory.</p>

<p>"I believe he did," replied Mrs. Squires, curtly.
"Abby Ann, go tell your father Mis' Jerome
wants him."</p>

<p>Abby Ann obeyed, and the lady passed out
into the front hall, and to the open door. A cascade
of filmy lace and muslin floated from her
shoulders and trailed across the shiny oil-cloth.
As the last frill swept across the threshold, Mrs.
Squires closed the door upon it with a sharp
report.</p>

<p>Before the door a little girl was playing on the
green slope, while an elderly woman with a grave,
kindly face sat looking on.</p>

<p>Farmer Squires, summoned by his daughter,
came round the corner of the house. He touched
his straw hat awkwardly.</p>

<p>"They's a young feller," he said, "that lives a
mile or so up the river, that has a tip-top team&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
kivered kerridge an' a fust-rate young hoss. His
folks has seen better days, the Grangers has, an'
Rob is proud as Lucifer, but they's a big mortgage
on the farm, an' he's 'mazin' ambitious ter
pay it off. So when I told him about you, he
said he'd see about it. He wouldn't let no woman
drive his hoss, but he thought mebbe he'd drive
ye round hisself. Shouldn't wonder if he was up
to-night."</p>

<p>"I wish he might come," said the lady. "My
physician said I must ride every day, and I am too
cowardly to drive if the horse were ever so gentle."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I guess you couldn't hold in Rob's colt
with them wrists," said he, glancing admiringly at
the slender, jewelled hands. "I shouldn't wonder
if that was Rob now."</p>

<p>At this moment wheels were heard rapidly approaching,
and a carriage appeared in sight. A
young man was driving. He held the reins with
firm hand, keeping his eyes fixed upon the fine-stepping
animal, turned dexterously up the slope,
brought the horse to a stand-still before the door,
and sprang lightly to the ground.</p>

<p>He was a remarkable-looking young fellow, tall
above the average, and finely proportioned. Hair
and mustache were dark, eyes of an indescribable
gray, and shaded by thick, black brows. A proud
yet frank smile rested on his handsome face.</p>

<p>"Hello, Rob," said Farmer Squires. "Here's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the lady that wanted ter see ye. Mister Granger,
Mis' Jerome."</p>

<p>The lady bowed, with a trace of hauteur in her
manner at first, but she looked with one of her
slow glances into the young man's face, and then
extended her hand, and the white fingers rested
for an instant in his brown palm. Granger returned
her greeting with a bow far from awkward,
while a rich color surged into his sun-browned
face.</p>

<p>"That is a magnificent horse of yours, Mr.
Granger," said Mrs. Jerome. "I hope he is
tractable. I was nearly killed in a runaway once,
and since then I am very timid."</p>

<p>"Oh, he is very gentle," said Granger, caressing
the fiery creature's beautiful head. "If you
like, I will take you for a drive now&mdash;if it is not
too late."</p>

<p>"Certainly, I would like it very much. Nettie,"
she said, turning to the woman, "bring my hat
and Lill's, and some wraps."</p>

<p>The woman obeyed, and in a few moments Mrs.
Jerome and her child were whirling over the lovely
country road. Their departure was witnessed by
the entire Squires family, including an obese dog
of somnolent habits, and old Sal, the gray mare,
who thrust her serious face over the stone wall opposite,
and gazed contemplatively down the road
after the retreating carriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think you will be afraid?" asked
Granger, as he helped Mrs. Jerome to alight.</p>

<p>"Oh no," she answered, with a very charming
smile. "The horse is as docile as he is fiery. I
shall enjoy the riding immensely. Do you think
you can come every day?"</p>

<p>"I shall try to&mdash;at least for the present."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jerome watched the carriage out of sight.</p>

<p>"How very interesting!" she was thinking.
"Who would dream of finding such a face here!
And yet&mdash;I don't know&mdash;one would hardly find
such a face out in the world. Perhaps it will not
be so dull after all. I thought they were all like
Squires!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For several succeeding weeks there was seldom
a day when the fiery black horse and comfortable
old carriage did not appear before the farm-house
door, and but few of those days when Mrs. Jerome
did not avail herself of the opportunity, sometimes
accompanied by the child and Nettie, oftener by
the child alone.</p>

<p>The interest and curiosity with which young
Granger had inspired Mrs. Jerome in the beginning,
deepened continually. A true son of the
soil, descendant of a long line of farmers, whence
came this remarkable physical beauty, this refined,
almost poetic, temperament, making it impossible
for him, in spite of the unconventionally of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
manner, to do a rude or ungraceful act? It was
against tradition, she thought,&mdash;against precedent.
It puzzled and fascinated her. She found it impossible
to treat him as an inferior, notwithstanding
the relation in which he stood to her. Indeed,
she soon ceased to think of that at all. The books
which she took with her upon their protracted drives
were seldom opened. She found it pleasanter to
lie back in the corner of the carriage, and watch
the shifting panorama of hill and forest and lake
through which they were driving. That the handsome
head with its clustering locks and clear-cut
profile, which was always between her and the
landscape, proved a serious obstruction to the view,
and that her eyes quite as often occupied themselves
with studying the play of those mobile lips,
and the nervous tension of those sun-browned
hands upon the reins, was, perhaps, natural and
unavoidable.</p>

<p>She talked with him a great deal, too, in her
careless, fluent way, or rather to him, for the conversation
on Granger's part was limited to an occasional
eager question, a flash of his fine eyes, or an
appreciative smile at some witty turn. She talked
of many things, but with delicate tact avoided such
themes as might prove embarrassing to an unsophisticated
mind&mdash;including books.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with a little shock of surprise
that she one day found him buried in the pages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Tennyson, a volume of whose poems she had left
upon the carriage seat while she and Lill explored
a neighboring pasture for raspberries.</p>

<p>He was lying at full length in the sweet-fern, one
arm beneath his head, his face eager and absorbed.
He did not notice her approach, and she had been
standing near him for some moments before he became
aware of her presence. Then, closing the
book, he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"So you read poetry, Mr. Granger?" she said,
arching her straight brows slightly.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," he answered. "I have read a
good many of the old poets. My grandfather left
a small library, which came into my possession."</p>

<p>"Then you have read Shakspere&mdash;&mdash;" began
the lady.</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Granger, "Shakspere, and
Milton, and Pope, and Burns. Is it so strange?"
he asked, turning upon her one of his swift glances.
"If one plowman may write poetry another plowman
may read it, I suppose."</p>

<p>He spoke with bitterness, a deep flush rising to
his temples.</p>

<p>"And have you read modern authors too?"</p>

<p>"Very little. There is no opportunity here.
There is nothing here&mdash;nothing!" he answered,
flinging aside a handful of leaves he had unwittingly
gathered.</p>

<p>"Why do you stay here, then?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The question sprang, almost without volition,
from her lips. She would gladly have recalled it
the next moment.</p>

<p>Granger gave her another swift glance, and it
seemed to her that he repressed the answer which
was already upon his tongue. A strange, bitter
smile came to his lips.</p>

<p>"Let the shoemaker stick to his last," he said,
turning toward the carriage, "and the farmer to
his plow."</p>

<p>During the homeward ride he was even more
taciturn than usual. At the door, Mrs. Jerome
offered him the volume of Tennyson. He accepted
it, with but few words.</p>

<p>When he returned it, a few days later, it opened
of itself, and between the leaves lay a small cluster
of wild roses, and some lines were faintly marked.
They were these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"When she made pause, I knew not for delight;</div>
<div class="line i1">Because with sudden motion from the ground</div>
<div class="line">She raised her piercing orbs and filled with light</div>
<div class="line i1">The interval of sound."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Cleopatra!" Mrs. Jerome repeated softly,
"and like her, I thought there were 'no men to
govern in this wood.' Poor fellow!"</p>

<p>It was a few days, perhaps a week, later, when
Mrs. Jerome, who to the mystification of her host
and hostess had received no letters, and, to the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of their knowledge, had written none, up to this
time, followed a sudden impulse, and wrote the
following epistle:</p>


<p class="i2 p2">"<span class="smcap">My dear friend and physician</span>:&mdash;You advised, no, commanded
me, to eschew the world for a season, utterly and completely.
I have obeyed you to the letter. I will spare you details&mdash;enough
that I am gaining rapidly, and, wonderful to say, I am not in the
least <i>ennuyée</i>. On the contrary. The cream is delicious, the spring
water exquisite, the scenery lovely. Even the people interest me.
I am your debtor, as never before, and beg leave to sign myself,</p>

<p class="right">Your grateful friend and patient,</p>

<p class="right3 smcap">Helen Jerome.</p>


<p class="i2 p2">"P. S.&mdash;It would amuse me to know what the world says of my
disappearance. Keep my secret, on your very soul.</p>

<p class="right3">H. J."</p>

<p class="p2">Midsummer came, and passed, and Mrs. Jerome
still lingered. In her pursuit for health she had
been indefatigable. There was hardly a road
throughout the region which had been left untried,
hardly a forest path unexplored, or a mountain
spring untasted.</p>

<p>"For a woman that sets up for delicate," remarked
Mrs. Squires, as from her point of observation
behind the window-blinds she watched Mrs.
Jerome spring with a girl's elastic grace from the
carriage, "for a woman that sets up for delicate,
she can stan' more ridin' around, an' scramblin' up
mountains, than any woman I ever see. <i>I</i> couldn't
do it&mdash;that's sure an' sartain!"</p>

<p>"It's sperrit, Rhody, sperrit. Them's the kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
o' women that'll go through fire and flood to git
what they're after."</p>

<p>"Yes, an' drag everybody along with 'em,"
added Mrs. Squires, meaningly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was one place to which they rode which
held a peculiar charm for Mrs. Jerome,&mdash;a small
lake, deep set among the hills and lying always in
the shadow. Great pines grew down to its brink
and hung far out over its surface, which was almost
hidden by thickly growing reeds and the broad
leaves and shining cups of water-lilies. Dragonflies
darted over it, and a dreamy silence invested
it. A boat lay moored at the foot of the tangled
path which led from the road, and they often left
the carriage, and rowed and floated about until
night-fall among the reeds and lilies.</p>

<p>They were floating in this way, near the close of
a sultry August afternoon. Lill lay coiled upon a
shawl in the bottom of the boat, her arms full of
lilies whose lithe stems she was twining together,
talking to herself, meanwhile, in a pretty fashion of
her own.</p>

<p>Granger was seated in the bow of the boat, with
folded arms, and eyes fixed upon the dark water.
His face was pale and moody. It had worn that
expression often of late, and he had fallen into a
habit of long intervals of silence and abstraction.</p>

<p>The beautiful woman who sat opposite him, idly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
trailing one hand, whiter and rosier than the lily it
held, in the water, seemed also under some unusual
influence. She had not spoken for some time.
Now and then she would raise the white lids of her
wonderful eyes, and let them sweep slowly over the
downcast face of Granger.</p>

<p>The dusky water lay around them still as death,
reflecting in black masses the overhanging pines.
The air was warm and full of heavy odors and
drowsy sounds, through which a bird's brief song
rang out, now and then, thrillingly sweet.</p>

<p>The atmosphere seemed to Mrs. Jerome to become
every moment more oppressive. A singular
agitation began to stir in her breast, which showed
itself in a faint streak of red upon either cheek. At
last this feeling became unendurable, and she started
with a sudden motion which caused the boat to
rock perilously.</p>

<p>Granger, roused by this movement, seized the
oars, and with a skilful stroke brought the boat
again to rest.</p>

<p>"Will you row across to the other side?" the
lady said. "I saw some rare orchids there which
must be in bloom by this time."</p>

<p>Granger took up the oars again and rowed as directed.
When the orchids had been found and
gathered, at Mrs. Jerome's request he spread her
a shawl beneath a tree, and seated himself near
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"How beautiful it is here!" she said, after a
pause. "I would like to stay and see the moon
rise over those pines. It rises early to-night. You
don't mind staying?" she added, looking at Granger.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;" he answered, slowly, "I don't mind it
in the least."</p>

<p>"How different it must look here in winter!"
she said, presently.</p>

<p>"Yes; as different as life and death."</p>

<p>"I cannot bear to think I shall never see it
again," she said, after another and longer pause,
"and yet I must leave it so soon!"</p>

<p>"Soon!" Granger echoed, with a start. "You
are going away soon, then?" he asked, in a husky
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;very soon&mdash;in two weeks, I think."</p>

<p>Granger made no reply. He bent his head and
began searching among the leaves and moss. His
eyes fell upon one of the lady's hands, which lay
carelessly by her side, all its perfections and the
splendor of its jewels relieved against the crimson
background of the shawl.</p>

<p>He could not look away from it, but bent lower
and lower, until his hair and his quick breath
swept across the fair fingers.</p>

<p>At the touch a wonderful change passed over
the woman. She started and trembled violently&mdash;her
face grew soft and tender. She raised the
hand which was upon her lap, bent forward and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
laid it, hesitatingly, tremblingly, upon the bowed,
boyish head.</p>

<p>"Robert! Robert!" she whispered.</p>

<p>Granger raised his head. For a moment, which
seemed an age, the two looked into each other's
face. Hers was full of yearning tenderness and
suffused with blushes&mdash;his, rigid and incredulous,
yet lighted up with a wild joy. A hoarse cry
broke from his lips&mdash;he thrust aside the hand
which lingered upon his head, sprang to his feet,
and went away.</p>

<p>The color faded from Mrs. Jerome's face. She
sat, for a moment, as if turned to stone, her eyes,
dilated and flashing, fixed upon Granger's retreating
figure. Then, with an impetuous gesture, she
rose and went to look for Lill. A scream from the
little girl fell upon her ears at the same moment.
She had strayed out upon a log which extended
far into the water, and stood poised, like a bird,
upon its extreme end. Round her darted a blue-mailed
dragon-fly, against which the little arms
were beating in terror. Another instant, and she
would be in the water. Mrs. Jerome sprang toward
her, but Granger was already there. As he gave
the frightened child into her mother's arms, he
looked into her face. She returned his gaze with
a haughty glance, and walked swiftly toward the
boat. He took his seat in the bow and rowed
across the lake in silence. Lill buried her scared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
little face in her mother's lap, and no one spoke.
As they landed, a great, dark bird rose suddenly
out of the bushes, and with a hideous, mocking
cry, like the laugh of a maniac, swept across the
water. The woman started and drew the child
closer to her breast.</p>

<p>They drove along in silence until within a mile
of the Squires' farm, when, without a word, Granger
turned into a road over which their drives had
never before extended. It was evidently a by-way,
and little used, for grass grew thickly between the
ruts. On the brow of a hill he halted.</p>

<p>Below, in the valley, far back from the road-side,
stood an old, square mansion, of a style unusual in
that region. It must have been a place of consequence
in its day and generation. The roof was
hipped, and broken by dormer windows, and a
carved lintel crowned the door-way. An air of age
and decay hung about it and the huge, black barns
with sunken roofs, and the orchard, full of gnarled
and barren trees, which flanked it. A broad,
grass-grown avenue, stiffly bordered by dishevelled-looking
Lombardy poplars, led up to the door.</p>

<p>Granger turned slowly, and looked full into Mrs.
Jerome's face. His own was terribly agitated.
Doubt, questioning, passionate appeal, spoke from
every feature.</p>

<p>"That is the old Granger place," he said, in a
strange, choked voice, with a gesture toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
house, "and that"&mdash;as a woman appeared for an
instant in the door-way&mdash;"that woman&mdash;&mdash;is <i>my
wife</i>!"</p>

<p>The desperate look in his face intensified. His
eyes seemed endeavoring to pierce into her inmost
soul. His lips moved as if to speak again, but
speech failed him. A quick breath escaped the
lady's parted lips, and she gave him a swift,
startled glance.</p>

<p>It was but a passing ripple on the surface of her
high-bred calm. However, a smile, the slow,
sweet, slightly scornful smile he knew so well, came
to her lips again the next instant. She raised her
eye-glasses and glanced carelessly over the scene.</p>

<p>"Nice old place!" she said, in her soft, indifferent
way. "Quite an air about it, really!"</p>

<p>Granger turned and lashed the horse into a
gallop. His teeth were set&mdash;his blue-gray eyes
flashed.</p>

<p>When the door was reached he lifted the woman
and her child from the carriage, and drove madly
away, the impact of the wheels with the rocky road
sending out fierce sparks as they whirled along.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jerome gathered her lilies into her arms
and went slowly up to her room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Several days passed, and Robert Granger did
not appear. The harvest was now at its height,
and the farmers prolonged their labors until sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>set,
and often later. This was the ostensible
reason for his remaining away. During these days
Mrs. Jerome was in a restless mood. She wandered
continually about the woods and fields near
the farm-house, remaining out far into the bright,
dewless nights. One evening she complained of
headache, and remained in-doors, sitting in <i>négligé</i>
by the window, looking listlessly out over the
orchard. Nettie came in from a stroll with Lill,
and gave her mistress a letter.</p>

<p>"We met Mr. Granger, and he gave me this,
madam," she said, respectfully, but her glance
rested with some curiosity upon the face of Mrs.
Jerome as she spoke.</p>

<p>The letter remained unopened upon her lap long
after Nettie had gone with the child to her room.
Finally, she tore the envelope open and read:</p>

<p class="p2 i2">"What is the use of struggling any longer? You have seen,
from the first day, that I was entirely at your mercy. There have
been times when I thought you were coldly and deliberately trying
your power over me; and there have been other times when I
thought you were laughing at me, and I did not care, so long as I
could see your face and hear your voice. I never allowed myself to
think of the end. Now all is changed. What has happened? I
am too miserable&mdash;and too madly happy&mdash;to think clearly; but, unless
I am quite insane, I have heard your voice speaking my name,
and I have seen in your face a look which meant&mdash;no, I <i>cannot</i> write
it! It was something I have never dared dream of, and I cannot
believe it, even now; and yet, I <i>cannot</i> forget that moment! If it
is a sin to write this&mdash;if it is a wrong to you&mdash;I swear I have never
meant to sin, and I would have kept silent forever but for that mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>ment.
Then, too, it flashed upon me for the first time that you
did not know I was not free to love you. It <i>must</i> be that you did
not know&mdash;the doubt is an insult to your womanhood&mdash;and yet,
when I tried to make sure of this, how you baffled me! But still
<i>that moment</i> remains unforgotten. What does it all mean? I
must have an answer! I shall come to-morrow, at the usual time.
If you refuse to see me, I shall understand. If not&mdash;what then?</p>

<p class="right3">"R. G."</p>

<p class="p2">The letter fell to the floor, and Helen Jerome sat
for a while with heaving breast and hands clasped
tightly over her face. Then she rose and paced up
and down the chamber, pausing at length before
one of the photographs with which she had
adorned the bare walls. Through sombre, lurid
vapors swept the figures of two lovers, with wild,
wan faces, clasped in an eternal embrace of anguish.
She looked at the picture a long time with a brooding
face. In the dusk the floating figures seemed
to expand into living forms, their lips to utter
audible cries of despair.</p>

<p>"Even at that price?"</p>

<p>She shuddered as the words escaped her lips,
and turned away. There was a tap at the door,
and, before she could speak, a woman entered,&mdash;a
spare, plain-featured woman, dressed in a dark
cotton gown and coarse straw hat. There was
something gentle, yet resolute, in her manner, as
she came toward Mrs. Jerome, her eyes full of repressed,
yet eager, scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Good evenin', ma'am," she said, extending a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
vinaigrette of filigree and crystal. "I was comin'
up this way an' I thought I'd bring ye your bottle.
Leastways, I s'pose it's yourn. It fell out o' Rob's
pocket."</p>

<p>She let her eyes wander while she was speaking
over the falling golden hair, the rich <i>robe-de-chambre</i>,
and back to the beautiful proud face.</p>

<p>"Thank you, it <i>is</i> mine," said Mrs. Jerome.
"Are you Robert Granger's mother?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am. I am his wife's mother. My
name is Mary Rogers."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jerome went to the window and seated
herself. The hem of her dress brushed against the
letter, and she stooped and picked it up, crushing
it in her hand. The visitor did not offer to go.
She had even removed her hat, and stood nervously
twisting its ribbons in her hard, brown
fingers.</p>

<p>"Will you sit down, Mrs. Rogers?"</p>

<p>The woman sank upon a chair without speaking.
She was visibly embarrassed, moving her hands
and feet restlessly about, and then bursting into
sudden speech.</p>

<p>"I've got somethin' I want to say to ye, Mis'
Jerome. It's kind o' hard to begin&mdash;harder'n I
thought 'twould be."</p>

<p>She spoke in a strained, trembling voice, with
many pauses.</p>

<p>"It's something that ought to be said, an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
there's nobody to say it but me. Perhaps&mdash;you
don't know&mdash;that folks round here is a-talkin'
about&mdash;about you an' Rob."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jerome smiled&mdash;a scornful smile which
showed her beautiful teeth. The woman saw it,
and her swarthy face flushed.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it matters to you, ma'am, if
they be," she said, bitterly, "an' it ain't on your
account I come. It's on Ruby's account. Ruby's
my darter. Oh, Mis' Jerome,"&mdash;she dropped her
indignant tone, and spoke pleadingly,&mdash;"you don't
look a bit like a wicked woman, only proud,
an' used to havin' men praise ye, an' I'm sure if
you could see Ruby you'd pity her, ma'am.
She's a-worryin' an' breakin' her heart over Rob's
neglectin' of her so, but she don't know what folks
is a-sayin'. I've kep' it from her so far, but
I'm afeard I can't keep it much longer, for folks
keeps a throwin' out 'n' hintin' round, and if Ruby
should find it out&mdash;the way she is now&mdash;it'd <i>kill</i>
her!"</p>

<p>She stopped, rocking herself to and fro, until she
could control her shaking voice.</p>

<p>"I never wanted her to <i>hev</i> Rob Granger," she
began again, speaking hurriedly, "an' I tried to
hender it all I could. But 'twa'n't no use. I knew
'twould come to this, sooner or later. 'Twas in his
father, an' it's in him. The Grangers was all of
'em alike&mdash;proud an' high-sperrited, an' never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
knowin' their own minds two days at a time. It's
in the blood, an' readin' po'try an' sich don't make
it no better. I knowed Ruby wa'n't no match for
Rob; she's gentle an' quiet, an' ain't got much
book-larnin'. But her heart was sot on him, poor
gal!"</p>

<p>And again she paused, sobbing gently now, and
wiping her eyes on her apron. Mrs. Jerome rose
and went over to her. A wonderful change had
passed over her. Every trace of pride and scorn
had faded from her face. She was gentle, almost
timid, in manner, as she stood before the weeping
woman.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Rogers," she said, kindly, "I cannot tell
you how sorry I am. It is all unnecessary, I assure
you. It is very foolish of people to talk. I
shall see that you have no more trouble on my&mdash;on
this account. If I had known"&mdash;she hesitated,
stammering. "You see, Mrs. Rogers, I did not
even know that Robert Granger was married. If
I had, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The woman looked up incredulously. The blood
tingled hot through Mrs. Jerome's veins as she
answered, with a sting of humiliation at her position.</p>

<p>"It may seem strange&mdash;it <i>is</i> strange, but no one
has ever mentioned it to me until&mdash;a few days ago.
Besides, as I tell you, there is no need for talk.
There <i>shall</i> be none. You can go home in perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
confidence that you will have no further cause for
trouble&mdash;that I can prevent."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rogers rose and took the lady's soft hand
in hers.</p>

<p>"God bless ye, ma'am. Ye'll do what's right,
I know. You must forgive me for thinking wrong
of ye, but you see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off in confusion.</p>

<p>"It is no matter," said Mrs. Jerome. "You
did not know me, of course. Good-night."</p>

<p>When the door had closed upon her visitor, she
stood for a while motionless, leaning her head
wearily against the window-frame.</p>

<p>"Strange," she said to herself, "that she should
have reminded me of&mdash;mother! It must have
been her voice."</p>

<p>A breeze strayed in at the window, and brought
up to her face the scent of the lilies which stood in
a dish upon the bureau. She seized the bowl with
a hasty gesture, and threw the flowers far out into
the orchard.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jerome arose very early the next morning
and went down for a breath of the fresh, sweet air.
Early as it was, the farmer had been to the village
to distribute his milk, and came rattling up the
road with his wagon full of empty cans. He
drove up to the door, and, with an air of importance,
handed the lady a letter, staring inquisitively
at her haggard face as he did so. The letter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
merely a friendly one from her physician, in
answer to her own, and said, among other things:</p>

<p class="i2 p2">"Van Cassalear is in town. All my ingenuity was called into action
in the effort to answer his persistent inquiries in regard to you.
As glad as I am that you are so content, and inured to human suffering
as I am supposed to be, I could not but feel a pang of sympathy
for him. His state is a melancholy one. The world has long since
ceased conjecturing as to your whereabouts. You are one of those
privileged beings who are at liberty to do and dare. Your mysterious
disappearance is put down with your other eccentricities."</p>

<p class="p2">Although, under ordinary circumstances, not a
woman to care for a pretext for anything she chose
to do, she allowed the reception of this letter to
serve in the present instance as an excuse for her
immediate departure&mdash;for she had resolved to go
away at once.</p>

<p>The surprise of Mr. Squires when her intention
was made known to him was great, and tinged with
melancholy&mdash;a melancholy which his wife by no
means shared. But his feelings were considerably
assuaged by the check handed him by Nettie, for
an amount far greater than he had any reason to
expect.</p>

<p>"I might 'a' got Rob to take 'em down to the
station, if I'd a-known it sooner," he remarked to
his wife, in Mrs. Jerome's hearing, "but I seen
him an hour ago drivin' like thunder down toward
Hingham, an' he won't be back in time. I guess
old Sal can drag the folks down to the station,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
an' I'll see if I can get Tim Higgins to take the
things. Time I's about it, too. Train goes at
one."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jerome went to her room and dressed herself
in travelling attire. Leaving Nettie to finish
packing, she took her hat and went out and down
the road, walking very rapidly. All along the
road-side August was flaunting her gay banners.
Silvery clematis and crimsoning blackberry vines
draped the rough stone walls; hard-hack, both
pink and white, asters and golden-rod, and many
a humble, nameless flower and shrub, filled all the
intervening spaces; yellow birds swung airily upon
the purple tufts of the giant thistles, and great
red butterflies hovered across her pathway. She
passed on, unheeding, until the grassy by-road was
reached, into which she turned, and stood for a
moment on the summit of the hill, looking down
upon the Granger homestead. A woman came out
as she looked, and leaned over the flowers which
bloomed in little beds on each side of the door-way.
Mrs. Jerome half turned, as if to retrace her
steps, and then walked resolutely down the hill and
up the avenue. The woman saw her coming,
stared shyly from beneath her hand in rustic
fashion for a moment, and then ran into the house,
where she could be seen peeping from between the
half-closed window-blinds.</p>

<p>As she came nearer the house, Mrs. Jerome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
slackened her steps. Her limbs trembled, she
panted slightly, and a feeling of faintness came
over her. The woman she had seen came again
to the door, and stood there silently as if waiting
for the stranger to speak&mdash;a timid, delicate young
creature, with great innocent blue eyes and apple-bloom
complexion. The lady looked into the shy
face a moment and came forward, holding out her
gloved hand.</p>

<p>"Are you Mrs. Granger?"</p>

<p>The little woman nodded, and the apple-bloom
color spread to her blue-veined temples.</p>

<p>"I am Mrs. Jerome," she continued. "You
must have heard your&mdash;husband speak of me."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Granger, simply, "I've
heard tell of you."</p>

<p>Meantime she was studying her guest with innocent
curiosity&mdash;the lovely proud face, the supple
figure, the quiet elegance of the toilet, with all its
subtle perfection of detail. It did not irritate her
as it did Mrs. Squires; it only filled her with gentle
wonder and enthusiasm. She tried at length to
shake off the timidity which possessed her.</p>

<p>"You must be real tired," she said gently.
"It's a long walk. Won't you come in?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the lady. "I think I <i>am</i>
very tired. If you would be so kind as to give me
a chair, I would sit here in the shade awhile."</p>

<p>She sank into the chair which Mrs. Granger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
brought, and drank eagerly the cool water which
she proffered.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said. "It is pleasant, here,
very. How lovely your flowers are."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Granger, with a show of
pride, "I love flowers, and they always bloom
well for me." She went to the beds and began
gathering some of the choicest. At the same moment,
Mrs. Rogers came through the hall. As she
saw the visitor, her face flushed, and she glanced
suspiciously, resentfully, from Mrs. Jerome to her
daughter.</p>

<p>The lady rose.</p>

<p>"It's Mis' Jerome, mother," said Ruby, simply,
"the lady that stays at Squireses."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jerome bowed, and a look of full understanding
passed between the two. Ruby, gathering
her flowers, saw nothing of it.</p>

<p>"I am going away, Mrs. Granger," said the
lady. "Circumstances require my immediate return
to the city. I came to leave a message with
you for&mdash;your husband, as he is not at home. Tell
him I thank him for the pleasure he has given me
this summer."</p>

<p>"I'm real sorry you took the trouble to come
down," said Mrs. Granger. "It's a long walk, an'
Squires could 'a' told Rob to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said the lady, consulting her
watch, "but I wanted a last walk."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>She held the little woman's hand at parting, and
looked long into the shy face. Then, stooping,
she lightly kissed her forehead, and, with the flowers
in her hand, went down the grassy avenue, up
the hill, and out of sight.</p>

<p>Robert Granger came home late in the afternoon.
He drove directly into the barn, and proceeded
to unharness and care for the jaded beast,
which was covered with foam and dust. He himself
was haggard and wild-eyed, and he moved
about with feverish haste. When he had made
the tired creature comfortable in his stall, he went
to the splendid animal in the one adjoining and
began to bestow similar attentions upon him.
While he was thus engaged, Mrs. Rogers came
into the stable. Her son-in-law hardly raised his
eyes. She watched him sharply for a moment,
and came nearer.</p>

<p>"Ain't ye comin' in to get somethin' to eat, Rob?"</p>

<p>"I have been to dinner," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Rob," said the woman, quietly, "ye might as
well let that go&mdash;ye won't need Dick to-day."</p>

<p>Granger started, almost dropping the card he
was using.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked, with an effort
at indifference, resuming his work on Dick's shining
mane.</p>

<p>"The lady's gone away," said Mrs. Rogers,
steadily watching him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"What!" cried Granger, glaring fiercely across
Dick's back. "What did you say? Who's gone
away?"</p>

<p>"The lady&mdash;Mis' Jerome," repeated the woman.
"She come down herself to leave word for ye,
seein' that you wa'n't at home. She was called
away onexpected. Said she'd enjoyed herself first-rate
this summer&mdash;an' was much obleeged to ye
for your kindness."</p>

<p>Granger continued his labor, stooping so low
that his mother-in-law could only see his shoulders
and the jetty curls which clustered at his neck. She
smiled as she looked&mdash;a somewhat bitter smile.
She was a good and gentle creature, but Ruby was
her daughter&mdash;her only child. After a moment or
two she went away.</p>

<p>When she was out of hearing, Granger rose.
He was pale as death, and his forehead was covered
with heavy drops. He leaned weakly against
Dick, who turned his fine eyes lovingly on his
master and rubbed his head against his sleeve.</p>

<p>Granger hid his face upon his arms.</p>

<p>"My God!" he cried, "is that the answer?"</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> the answer. It was all the answer
Granger ever received. He did not kill himself.
He did not attempt to follow or even write to her.
Why should he? She had come and had gone,&mdash;a
beautiful, bewildering, maddening vision.</p>

<p>Neither did he try the old remedy of dissipation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
as a meaner nature might have done; but he could
not bear the quiet meaning of Mrs. Rogers' looks,
nor the mute, reproachful face of his wife, and he
fell into a habit of wandering with dog and gun
through the mountains, coming home with empty
game-bag, late at night, exhausted and dishevelled,
to throw himself upon his bed and sleep long,
heavy slumbers. Without knowing it, he had
taken his sore heart to the surest and purest counsellor;
and little by little those solitary communings
with nature had their healing effect.</p>

<p>"Let him be, Ruby," her mother would say, as
Ruby mourned and wondered. "Let him be.
The Grangers was all of 'em queer. Rob'll come
round all right in course of time."</p>

<p>Weeks and months went by in this way, and one
morning, after a night of desperate pain and
danger, Robert Granger's first-born was laid in his
arms. Then he buried his face in the pillow by
pale, smiling Ruby, and sent up a prayer for forgiveness
and strength. True, only God and attending
angels heard it, but Ruby Granger was a
happier woman from that day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Van Cassalear was passing along the city
street, leaning upon her husband's arm. It was
midsummer. "Everybody" was out of town, and
the Van Cassalears were only there for a day, <i>en
passant</i>. They were walking rapidly, the lady's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
delicate drapery gathered in one hand, a look of
proud indifference upon her face.</p>

<p>"Pond-lilies! Pond-lilies!"</p>

<p>She paused. Upon a street-corner stood a sun-burned,
bare-foot boy, in scant linen suit and
coarse farmer's hat. His hands were full of lilies,
which he was offering for sale.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Cassalear dropped her husband's arm
and the white draperies fell unheeded to the pavement.
She almost snatched the lilies from the
boy's hands, and bowed her face over them.</p>

<p>The city sights and sounds faded away. Before
her spread a deep, dark lake, its surface flecked
with lilies. Tall pines bent over it, and in their
shadow drifted a boat, and an impassioned, boyish
face looked at her from the boat's prow....</p>

<p>"Six for five cents, lady, please!"</p>

<p>"Do you want the things, Helen?" said Van
Cassalear, the least trace of impatience in his
voice. "If you do, let me pay the boy and we'll
go on. People are staring."</p>

<p>The lady raised her eyes and drew a deep
breath.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I will not have them."</p>

<p>She returned the lilies, with a piece of money,
to the astonished boy, gathered her drapery again
into her hand, and swept on.</p>

<h2 id="ANGEL">MY FRIEND MRS. ANGEL.<br />
<span class="medium">A WASHINGTON SKETCH.</span></h2></div>


<p>My acquaintance with Mrs. Angel dates from
the hour she called upon me, in response to my application
at a ladies' furnishing store for a seamstress;
and the growth of the acquaintance, as well
as the somewhat peculiar character which it assumed,
was doubtless due to the interest I betrayed
in the history of her early life, as related to me at
different times, frankly and with unconscious pathos
and humor.</p>

<p>Her parents were of the "poor white" class and
lived in some remote Virginian wild, whose precise
locality, owing to the narrator's vague geographical
knowledge, I could never ascertain. She was
the oldest of fifteen children, all of whom were
brought up without the first rudiments of an education,
and ruled over with brutal tyranny by a
father whose sole object in life was to vie with his
neighbors in the consumption of "black jack" and
corn whiskey, and to extract the maximum of labor
from his numerous progeny,&mdash;his paternal affection
finding vent in the oft-repeated phrase,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
"Durn 'em, I wish I could sell some on 'em!"
The boys, as they became old enough to realize
the situation, ran away in regular succession;&mdash;the
girls, in the forlorn hope of exchanging a cruel
master for one less so, drifted into matrimony at
the earliest possible age. Mrs. Angel, at the age
of sixteen, married a man of her own class, who
found his way in course of time to Washington
and became a day-laborer in the Navy Yard.</p>

<p>It would be interesting, if practicable, to trace
the subtle laws by which this woman became possessed
of a beauty of feature and form, and color,
which a youth spent in field-work, twenty subsequent
years of maternity and domestic labor, and
a life-long diet of the coarsest description, have
not succeeded in obliterating. Blue, heavily fringed
eyes, wanting only intelligence to make them really
beautiful; dark, wavy hair, delicately formed ears,
taper fingers, and a fair, though faded complexion,
tell of a youth whose beauty must have been striking.</p>

<p>She seldom alluded to her husband at all, and
never by name, the brief pronoun "he" answering
all purposes, and this invariably uttered in a
tone of resentment and contempt, which the story
of his wooing sufficiently accounts for.</p>

<p>"His folks lived over t'other side the mount'n,"
she related, "an' he was dead sot an' <i>de</i>-termined
he'd have me. I never did see a man so sot! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Lord knows why! He used ter foller me 'round
an' set an' set, day in an' day out. I kep' a-tellin'
of him I couldn't a-bear him, an' when I said it,
he'd jess look at me an' kind o' grin like, an' never
say nothin', but keep on a-settin' 'roun'. Mother
<i>she</i> didn't dare say a word, 'cause she knowed
father 'lowed I should have him whether or no.
''Taint no use, Calline,' she'd say, 'ye might as
well give up fust as last.' Then he got ter comin'
every day, an' he an' father jess sot an' smoked,
an' drunk whiskey, an' <i>he</i> a-starin' at me all the
time as if he was crazy, like. Bimeby I took ter
hidin' when he come. Sometimes I hid in the
cow-shed, an' sometimes in the woods, an' waited
till he'd cl'ared out, an' then when I come in the
house, father he'd out with his cowhide, an' whip
me. 'I'll teach ye,' he'd say, swearin' awful, 'I'll
teach ye ter honor yer father an' mother, as
brought ye inter the world, ye hussy!' An' after
a while, what with that, an' seein' mother a-cryin'
'roun', I begun ter git enough of it, an' at last I
got so I didn't keer. So I stood up an' let him
marry me; but," she added, with smouldering
fire in her faded blue eyes, "I 'lowed I'd make
him sorry fur it, an' I reckon I <i>hev</i>! But he won't
let on. Ketch him!"</p>

<p>This, and her subsequent history, her valorous
struggle with poverty, her industry and tidiness, her
intense, though blindly foolish, love for her numer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>ous
offspring, and a general soft-heartedness toward
all the world, except "niggers" and the father of
her children, interested me in the woman to an extent
which has proved disastrous to my comfort&mdash;and
pocket. I cannot tell how it came about, but
at an early period of our acquaintance Mrs. Angel
began to take a lively interest in my wardrobe, not
only promptly securing such articles as I had
already condemned as being too shabby, even for
the wear of an elderly Government employé, but
going to the length of suggesting the laying aside
of others which I had modestly deemed capable of
longer service. From this, it was but a step to
placing a species of lien upon all newly purchased
garments, upon which she freely commented, with
a view to their ultimate destination. It is not
pleasant to go through the world with the feeling
of being mortgaged as to one's apparel, but though
there have been moments when I have meditated
rebellion, I have never been able to decide upon
any practicable course of action.</p>

<p>I cannot recall the time when Mrs. Angel left
my room without a package of some description.
She carries with her always a black satchel, possessing
the capacity and insatiability of a conjurer's
bag, but, unlike that article, while almost anything
may be gotten into it, nothing ever comes out of
it.</p>

<p>Her power of absorption was simply marvellous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Fortunately, however, the demon of desire which
possesses her may be appeased, all other means
failing, with such trifles as a row of pins, a few
needles, or even stale newspapers.</p>

<p>"He reads 'em," she explained, concerning the
last, "an' then I dresses my pantry shelves with
'em."</p>

<p>"It is a wonder your husband never taught <i>you</i>
to read," I said once, seeing how wistfully she was
turning the pages of a "Harper's Weekly."</p>

<p>The look of concentrated hate flashed into her
face again.</p>

<p>"He 'lows a woman ain't got no call ter read,"
she answered, bitterly. "I allers laid off to larn,
jess ter spite him, but I ain't never got to it
yit."</p>

<p>I came home from my office one day late in
autumn, to find Mrs. Angel sitting by the fire in
my room, which, as I board with friends, is never
locked. Her customary trappings of woe were
enhanced by a new veil of cheap crape which swept
the floor, and her round, rosy visage wore an expression
of deep, unmitigated grief. A patch of <i>poudre
de riz</i> ornamented her tip-tilted nose, a delicate
aroma of Farina cologne-water pervaded the
atmosphere, and the handle of my ivory-backed
hair-brush protruded significantly from one of the
drawers of my dressing-bureau.</p>

<p>I glanced at her apprehensively. My first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
thought was that the somewhat mythical personage
known as "he" had finally shuffled himself out of
existence. I approached her respectfully.</p>

<p>"Good-evenin'," she murmured. "Pretty day!"</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mrs. Angel?" I responded,
sympathetically. "You seem to be in trouble.
What has happened?"</p>

<p>"A heap!" was the dismal answer. "Old Mr.
Lawson's dead!"</p>

<p>"Ah! Was he a near relative of yours?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Well," she answered,&mdash;somewhat dubiously, I
thought,&mdash;"not <i>so</i> nigh. He wasn't rightly <i>no kin</i>.
His fust wife's sister married my oldest sister's husband's
brother&mdash;but we's allers <i>knowed</i> him, an' he
was allers a-comin' an' a-goin' amongst us <i>like</i> one
o' the family. An' if ever they <i>was</i> a saint he was
one!"</p>

<p>Here she wiped away a furtive tear with a new
black-bordered kerchief. I was silent, feeling any
expression of sympathy on my part inadequate to
the occasion.</p>

<p>"He was <i>prepared</i>," she resumed, presently,
"ef ever a man was. He got religion about forty
year ago&mdash;that time all the stars fell down, ye
know. He'd been ter see his gal, an' was goin'
home late, and the stars was a-fallin', and he was
took then. He went into a barn, an' begun
prayin', an' he ain't never stopped sence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the black-bordered handkerchief was
brought into requisition.</p>

<p>"How are the children?" I ventured, after a
pause.</p>

<p>"Po'ly!" was the discouraging answer. "Jinny
an' Rosy an' John Henry has all had the croup.
I've been a-rubbin' of 'em with Radway's Relief
an' British ile, an' a-givin' on it to 'em internal, fur
two days an' nights runnin'. Both bottles is empty
now, and the Lord knows where the next is ter
come from, fur we ain't got no credit at the 'pothecary's.
<i>He's</i> out o' work ag'in, an' they ain't a
stick o' wood in the shed, an' the grocer-man says
he wants some money putty soon. Ef my <i>hens</i>
would only lay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was unfortunate," I could not help saying,
with a glance at the veil and handkerchief, "that
you felt obliged to purchase additional mourning
just when things were looking so badly."</p>

<p>She gave me a sharp glance, a glow of something
like resentment crept into her face.</p>

<p>"All our family puts on black fur kin, ef it <i>ain't</i>
so nigh!" she remarked with dignity.</p>

<p>A lineal descendant of an English earl could not
have uttered the words "our family" with more
hauteur. I felt the rebuke.</p>

<p>"Besides," she added, naïvely, "the store-keeper
<i>trusted</i> me fur 'em."</p>

<p>"If only Phenie could git work," she resumed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
presently, giving me a peculiar side-glance with
which custom had rendered me familiar, it being
the invariable precursor of a request, or a sly suggestion.
"She's only fifteen, an' she ain't over
'n' above <i>strong</i>, but she's got learnin'. She only
left off school a year ago come spring, an' she can
do right smart. There's Sam Weaver's gal, as
lives nex' do' to us, <i>she's</i> got a place in the printin'-office
where she 'arns her twenty-five dollars a
month, an' she never seen the day as she could
read like Phenie, an' she's ugly as sin, too."</p>

<p>It occurred to me just here that I had heard of
an additional force being temporarily required in
the Printing Bureau. I resolved to use what influence
I possessed with a prominent official, a friend
of "better days," to obtain employment for
"Phenie," for, with all the poor woman's faults and
weaknesses, I knew that her distress was genuine.</p>

<p>"I will see if I can find some employment for
your daughter," I said, after reflecting a few moments.
"Come here Saturday evening, and I will
let you know the result."</p>

<p>I knew, by the sudden animation visible in Mrs.
Angel's face, that this was what she had hoped for
and expected.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I came from the office on Saturday evening,
I found Mrs. Angel and her daughter awaiting
me. She had often alluded to Phenie with maternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
pride, as a "good-lookin' gal," but I was entirely
unprepared for such a vision as, at her mother's
bidding, advanced to greet me. It occurred to me
that Mrs. Angel herself must have once looked
somewhat as Phenie did now, except as to the
eyes. That much-contemned "he" must have
been responsible for the large, velvety black eyes
which met mine with such a timid, deprecating
glance.</p>

<p>She was small and perfectly shaped, and there
was enough of vivid coloring and graceful curve
about her to have furnished a dozen ordinary society
belles. Her hair fell loosely to her waist in
the then prevailing fashion, a silken, wavy, chestnut
mass. A shabby little hat was perched on one
side her pretty head, and the tightly fitting basque
of her dress of cheap faded blue exposed her white
throat almost too freely. I was glad that I could
answer the anxious pleading of those eyes in a
manner not disappointing. The girl's joy was a
pretty thing to witness as I told her mother that
my application had been successful, and that
Phenie would be assigned work on Monday.</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> 'lowed she wouldn't git in," remarked Mrs.
Angel, triumphantly, "an' as fur Columbus, <i>he</i>
didn't want her to git in no how."</p>

<p>"Oh <i>maw</i>!" interrupted Phenie, blushing like
a June rose.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the use!" continued her mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
"Columbus says he wouldn't 'low it nohow ef he'd
got a good stan'. He says as soon as ever he
gits inter business fur hisself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh <i>maw</i>!" interposed Phenie again, going to
the window to hide her blushes.</p>

<p>"Columbus is a butcher by trade," went on
Mrs. Angel, in a confidential whisper, "an'
Phenie, she don't like the idee of it. I tell her
she's foolish, but she don't like it. I reckon it's
readin' them story-papers, all about counts, an'
lords, an' sich, as has set her agin' butcherin'.
But Columbus, he jess loves the groun' she walks
on, an' he's a-goin' ter hucksterin' as soon as ever
he can git a good stan'."</p>

<p>I expressed a deep interest in the success of Columbus,
and rescued Phenie from her agony of confusion
by some remarks upon other themes of a
less personal nature. Soon after, mother and
daughter departed.</p>

<p>Eight o'clock Monday morning brought Phenie,
looking elated yet nervous. She wore the faded
blue dress, but a smart "butterfly-bow" of rose-pink
was perched in her shining hair, and another
was at her throat. As we entered the Treasury
building, I saw that she turned pale and trembled
as if with awe, and as we passed on through the
lofty, resounding corridors, and up the great flight
of steps, she panted like a hunted rabbit.</p>

<p>At the Bureau I presented the appointment-card<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
I had received. The superintendent gave it a
glance, scrutinized Phenie closely, beckoned to a
minor power, and in a moment the new employé
was conducted from my sight. Just as she disappeared
behind the door leading into the grimy,
noisy world of printing-presses, Phenie gave me a
glance over her shoulder. Such a trembling,
scared sort of a glance! I felt as if I had just
turned a young lamb into a den of ravening wolves.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, from this day the fortunes of
the house of Angel began to mend. "He" was reinstated
in "the Yard," the oldest boy began a
thriving business in the paper-selling line, and
Mrs. Angel herself being plentifully supplied with
plain sewing, the family were suddenly plunged
into a state of affluence which might well have upset
a stronger intellect than that of its maternal
head. Her lunacy took the mild and customary
form of "shopping." Her trips to the Avenue
(by which Pennsylvania Avenue is presupposed)
and to Seventh Street became of semi-weekly occurrence.
She generally dropped in to see me on
her way home, in quite a friendly and informal
manner (her changed circumstances had not made
her proud), and with high glee exhibited to me
her purchases. They savored strongly of Hebraic
influences, and included almost every superfluous
article of dress known to modern times. She also
supplied herself with lace curtains of marvellous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
design, and informed me that she had bought a
magnificent "bristles" carpet at auction, for a
mere song.</p>

<p>"The <i>bristles</i> is wore off in some places," she
acknowledged, "but it's most as good as new."</p>

<p>Her grief for the lamented Mr. Lawson found
new expression in "mourning" jewelry of a massive
and sombre character, including ear-rings of a
size which threatened destruction to the lobes of
her small ears. Her fledgelings were liberally
provided with new garments of a showy and fragile
nature, and even her feelings toward "him" became
sufficiently softened to allow the purchase of
a purple necktie and an embroidered shirt-bosom
for his adornment.</p>

<p>"He ain't not ter say <i>so</i> ugly, of a Sunday, when
he gits the smudge washed off," she remarked, in
connection with the above.</p>

<p>"It must have been a great satisfaction to you,"
I suggested (not without a slight tinge of malice),
"to be able to pay off the grocer and the dry-goods
merchant."</p>

<p>Mrs. Angel's spirits were visibly dampened by
this unfeeling allusion. Her beaming face darkened.</p>

<p>"They has to take their resks," she remarked,
sententiously, after a long pause, fingering her
hard-rubber bracelets, and avoiding my gaze.</p>

<p>Once I met her on the Avenue. She was issu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>ing
from a popular restaurant, followed by four or
five young Angels, all in high spirits and beaming
with the consciousness of well-filled stomachs, and
the possession of divers promising-looking paper
bags. She greeted me with an effusiveness which
drew upon me the attention of the passers-by.</p>

<p>"We've done had <i>oyshters</i>!" remarked John
Henry.</p>

<p>"'N' ice-cream 'n' cakes!" supplemented Rosy.</p>

<p>The fond mother exhibited, with natural pride,
their "tin-types," taken individually and collectively,
sitting and standing, with hats and
without. The artist had spared neither carmine
nor gilt-foil, and the effect was unique and dazzling.</p>

<p>"I've ben layin' off ter have 'em took these two
year," she loudly exclaimed, "an' I've done it!
He'll be mad as a hornet, but I don't keer! <i>He</i>
don't pay fur 'em!"</p>

<p>A vision of the long-suffering grocer and merchant
rose between me and those triumphs of the
limner's art, but then, as Mrs. Angel herself had
philosophically remarked, "they has to take their
resks."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Phenie, too, in the beginning, was a frequent
visitor, and I was pleased to note that her painful
shyness was wearing off a little, and to see a
marked improvement in her dress. There was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
with all her childishness, a little trace of coquetry
about her,&mdash;the innocent coquetry of a bird preening
its feathers in the sunshine. She was simply a
soft-hearted, ignorant little beauty, whose great,
appealing eyes seemed always asking for something,
and in a way one might find it hard to
refuse.</p>

<p>In spite of her rich color, I saw that the girl was
frail, and knowing that she had a long walk after
leaving the cars, I arranged for her to stay with me
overnight when the weather was severe, and she
often did so, sleeping on the lounge in my sitting-room.</p>

<p>At first I exerted myself to entertain my young
guest,&mdash;youth and beauty have great charms for
me,&mdash;but beyond some curiosity at the sight of
pictures, I met with no encouragement. The girl's
mind was a vacuum. She spent the hours before
retiring in caressing and romping with my kitten,
in whose company she generally curled up on the
hearth rug and went to sleep, looking, with her disarranged
curly hair and round, flushed cheeks, like
a child kept up after its bed-time.</p>

<p>But after a few weeks she came less frequently,
and finally not at all. I heard of her occasionally
through her mother, however, who reported favorably,
dilating most fervidly upon the exemplary
punctuality with which Phenie placed her earnings
in the maternal hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>It happened one evening in mid-winter that I
was hastening along Pennsylvania Avenue at an
early hour, when, as I was passing a certain restaurant,
the door of the ladies' entrance was
pushed noisily open, and a party of three came out.
The first of these was a man, middle-aged, well-dressed,
and of a jaunty and gallant air, the second
a large, high-colored young woman, the third&mdash;Phenie.
She looked flushed and excited, and was
laughing in her pretty, foolish way at something
her male companion was saying to her. My heart
stood still; but, as I watched the trio from the obscurity
of a convenient door-way, I saw the man
hail a Navy Yard car, assist Phenie to enter it,
and return to his friend upon the pavement.</p>

<p>I was ill at ease. I felt a certain degree of
responsibility concerning Phenie, and the next
day, therefore, I waited for her at the great iron
gate through which the employés of the Bureau
must pass out, determined to have a few words
with the child in private. Among the first to appear
was Phenie, and with her, as I had feared,
the high-colored young woman. In spite of that
person's insolent looks, I drew Phenie's little
hand unresistingly through my arm, and led her
away.</p>

<p>Outside the building, as I had half-expected,
loitered the man in whose company I had seen her
on the previous evening. Daylight showed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to be a type familiar to Washington eyes&mdash;large,
florid, scrupulously attired, and carrying himself
with a mingled air of military distinction and senatorial
dignity well calculated to deceive an unsophisticated
observer.</p>

<p>He greeted Phenie with a courtly bow, and a
smile, which changed quickly to a dark look as
his eyes met mine, and turned away with a sudden
assumption of lofty indifference and abstraction.</p>

<p>Phenie accompanied me to my room without a
word, where I busied myself in preparing some
work for her mother, chatting meanwhile of various
trifling matters.</p>

<p>I could see that the girl looked puzzled, astonished,
even a little angry. She kept one of her
small, dimpled hands hidden under the folds of her
water-proof, too, and her eyes followed me wistfully
and questioningly.</p>

<p>"Who were those people I saw you with last
evening, coming from H&mdash;&mdash;'s saloon?" I suddenly
asked.</p>

<p>Phenie gave me a startled glance; her face grew
pale.</p>

<p>"Her name," she stammered, "is Nettie Mullin."</p>

<p>"And the gentleman?" I asked again, with an
irony which I fear was entirely thrown away.</p>

<p>The girl's color came back with a rush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"His name is O'Brien, General O'Brien," she
faltered. "He&mdash;he's a great man!" she added,
with a pitiful little show of pride.</p>

<p>"Ah! Did he tell you so?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nettie told me," the girl answered, simply.
"She's known him a long time. He's rich and
has a great deal of&mdash;of influence, and he's promised
to get us promoted. He's a great friend of Nettie's,
and he&mdash;he's a perfect gentleman."</p>

<p>She looked so innocent and confused as she sat
rubbing the toe of one small boot across a figure
of the carpet, that I had not the heart to question
her further. In her agitation she had withdrawn
the hand she had kept hitherto concealed beneath
her cape, and was turning around and around the
showy ring which adorned one finger.</p>

<p>"I am certain, Phenie," I said, "that your
friend General O'Brien is no more a general and
no more a gentleman than that ring you are wearing
is genuine gold and diamonds."</p>

<p>She gave me a half-laughing, half-resentful look,
colored painfully, but said nothing, and went away
at length, with the puzzled, hurt look still on her
face.</p>

<p>For several days following I went every day to
the gate of the Bureau, and saw Phenie on her
homeward way. For two or three days "General
O'Brien" continued to loiter about the door-way,
but as he ceased at length to appear, and as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
system I had adopted entailed upon me much fatigue
and loss of time, I decided finally to leave
Phenie again to her own devices; not, however,
without some words of advice and warning. She
received them silently, but her large, soft eyes
looked into mine with the pathetic, wondering look
of a baby, who cannot comprehend why it shall
not put its hand into the blaze of the lamp.</p>

<p>I did not see her for some time after this, but
having ascertained from her mother that she was
in the habit of coming home regularly, my anxiety
was in a measure quieted.</p>

<p>"She don't seem nateral, Phenie don't," Mrs.
Angel said one day. "She's kind o' quiet, like,
as ef she was studyin' about something, an' she
used to be everlastin' singin' an' laughin'. Columbus,
he's a-gittin' kind o' oneasy an' jealous, like.
Says he, 'Mrs. Angel,' says he, 'ef Phenie should
go back on me after all, an' me a-scrapin', an'
a-savin', an' a-goin' out o' butcherin' along o' her
not favorin' it,' says he, 'why I reckon I wouldn't
never git over it,' says he. Ye see him an' her's
ben a-keepin' comp'ny sence Phenie was twelve
year old. I tells him he ain't no call ter feel oneasy,
though, not as <i>I</i> knows on."</p>

<p>Something urged me here to speak of what I
knew as to Phenie's recent associates, but other
motives&mdash;a regard for the girl's feelings, and reliance
upon certain promises she had made me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
mingled with a want of confidence in her mother's
wisdom and discretion&mdash;kept me silent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One evening&mdash;it was in March, and a little blustering&mdash;I
was sitting comfortably by my fire, trying
to decide between the attractions of a new
magazine and the calls of duty which required my
attendance at a certain "Ladies' Committee-meeting,"
when a muffled, unhandy sort of a knock
upon my door disturbed my train of thought. I
uttered an indolent "Come in!"</p>

<p>There was a hesitating turn of the knob, the door
opened, and I rose to be confronted by a tall,
broad-chested young man, of ruddy complexion and
undecided features; a young man who, not at all
abashed, bowed in a friendly manner, while his
mild, blue eyes wandered about the apartment with
undisguised eagerness. He wore a new suit of
invisible plaid, an extremely low-necked shirt, a
green necktie, and a celluloid pin in the form of a
shapely feminine leg. Furthermore, the little finger
of the hand which held his felt hat was gracefully
crooked in a manner admitting the display of
a seal ring of a peculiarly striking style, and an
agreeable odor of bergamot, suggestive of the
barber's chair, emanated from his person. It
flashed over me at once that this was Phenie
Angel's lover, a suspicion which his first words
verified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ain't Miss Angel here?" he asked, in a voice
full of surprise and disappointment.</p>

<p>"No, she is not," I answered. "You are her
friend, Columbus&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Columbus Dockett, ma'am," he responded.
"Yes, ma'am. Ain't Phenie been here this evenin'?"</p>

<p>"No. Did you expect to find her here?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dockett's frank face clouded perceptibly,
and he pushed his hair back and forth on his forehead
uneasily, as he answered:</p>

<p>"I did, indeed, ma'am. I&mdash;you see, ma'am,
she ain't been comin' home reg'lar of late, Phenie
ain't, an' I ain't had no good chance to speak to her
for right smart of a while. I laid off to see her to-night
for certain. I've got somethin' <i>partic'lar</i> to
say to her, to-night. You see, ma'am," he added,
becoming somewhat confused, "me an' her&mdash;we&mdash;I&mdash;me
an' her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, evidently feeling his inability to
express himself with the delicacy the subject required.</p>

<p>"I understand, Mr. Dockett," I said, smilingly,
"you and Phenie are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's it!" interposed Mr. Dockett, much
relieved. "Yes, ma'am, that's how the matter
stan's! I made sure of findin' Phenie here. Her
ma says as that's where she's been a-stayin' nights
lately."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>I started. I had not seen Phenie for two or
three weeks.</p>

<p>"I dare say she has gone home with one of the
girls from the Bureau," I said, reassuringly.</p>

<p>I had been studying the young man's face in the
meantime, and had decided that Mr. Dockett was
a very good sort of a fellow. There was good
material in him. It might be in a raw state, but
it was very good material, indeed. He might be
a butcher by trade, but surely he was the "mildest-mannered
man" that ever felled an ox. His
voice had a pleasant, sincere ring, and altogether
he looked like a man with whom it might be
dangerous to trifle, but who might be trusted to
handle a sick baby, or wait upon a helpless woman
with unlimited devotion.</p>

<p>"You don't have no idea who the girl might be?"
he asked, gazing dejectedly into the crown of his
hat. "'Tain't so late. I might find Phenie yit."</p>

<p>It happened, by the merest chance, that I did
know where Nettie Mullin, in whose company I
feared Phenie might again be found, boarded.
That is to say, I knew the house but not its number,
and standing as it did at a point where several
streets and avenues intersect, its situation was one
not easily imparted to another. I saw, by the look
of hopeless bewilderment on Mr. Dockett's face,
that he could have discovered the North-west Passage
with equal facility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>I reflected, hesitated, formed a hasty resolution,
and said:</p>

<p>"I am going out to attend a meeting, and I will
show you where one of the girls, with whom I
have seen Phenie, lives. You may find her there
now."</p>

<p>The young man's face brightened a little. He
expressed his thanks, and waited for me on the
landing.</p>

<p>The house where Miss Mullin boarded was only
a few squares away. It was one of a row of discouraged-looking
houses, which had started out
with the intention of being genteel but had long
ago given up the idea.</p>

<p>It was lighted up cheerfully, however, we saw
on approaching, and a hack stood before the door.
I indicated to my companion that this was the
house, and would have turned away, but at that
moment the door opened, and two girls came out
and descended the steps. The light from the hall,
as well as that of a street-lamp, fell full upon them.
There was no mistaking Miss Mullin, and her companion
was Phenie,&mdash;in a gay little hat set saucily
back from her face, the foolish, pretty laugh ringing
from her lips.</p>

<p>The two girls tripped lightly across the pavement
toward the carriage. As they did so, the
door was opened from within (the occupant, for
reasons best known to himself, preferring not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
alight), and a well-clad, masculine arm was gallantly
extended. Miss Mullin, giggling effusively,
was about to enter, followed close by Phenie,
when, with a smothered cry, Dockett darted forward
and placed himself between them and the
carriage.</p>

<p>"Phenie," he said, his voice shaking a little.
"Phenie, where was you a-goin'?"</p>

<p>The young girl started back, confused.</p>

<p>"Law, Columbus!" she faltered, in a scared,
faint voice.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the man in the carriage put his
face out of the door, and eyed the intruder, for an
instant, arrogantly. Then, affecting to ignore his
presence altogether, he turned toward the two
girls with a slightly impatient air, saying, in an indescribably
offensive tone:</p>

<p>"Come, ladies, come. What are you stopping
for?"</p>

<p>Dockett, who had been holding Phenie's little
hand speechlessly, let it fall, and turned toward the
carriage excitedly.</p>

<p>"Miss Angel is stoppin' to speak to <i>me</i>, sir,"
he said. "Have you got anything to say ag'inst
it?"</p>

<p>The occupant of the carriage stared haughtily at
him, broke into a short laugh, and turned again
toward the girls.</p>

<p>Dockett, pushing his hat down upon his head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
took a step nearer. The gentleman, after another
glance, drew back discreetly, saying, in a nonchalant
manner:</p>

<p>"Come, Miss Nettie. We shall be late."</p>

<p>"I suppose you're not going with us, then, Miss
Angel?" said Miss Mullin, with a toss of her
plumed hat.</p>

<p>Dockett turned, and looked Phenie steadily in
the face.</p>

<p>"<i>Be</i> you goin' with them?" he asked, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no!" the girl faltered, faintly. "I'll go
with you, Columbus."</p>

<p>A muffled remark of a profane nature was heard
to proceed from the carriage, the door was violently
closed, and the vehicle rolled rapidly away.</p>

<p>I had kept discreetly aloof, although an interested
spectator of the scene. Phenie, after one
swift glance in my direction, had not raised her
eyes again.</p>

<p>"We'll go with you where you're goin', ma'am,"
said Dockett, as the carriage disappeared, but I
would not permit this.</p>

<p>"Well, good evenin', ma'am," he said; "I'm a
thousand times obliged to you&mdash;good evenin'."</p>

<p>With an indescribable look into Phenie's pale,
down-cast face,&mdash;a look made up of pain, tenderness
and reproach,&mdash;he put her hand through his
arm, and they went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>As might have been expected, Phenie avoided
me, after this, more carefully than ever. I was
glad that she did so. I was also glad when, a week
or two later, Mrs. Angel presented herself, in a
towering state of indignation, to inform me that
Phenie had received her discharge. In vain I reminded
her that Phenie's position had been, from
the beginning, a temporary one.</p>

<p>"I don't keer!" she persisted. "I'd like ter
know what difference it would 'a' made to the
Government&mdash;jess that little bit o' money! An'
me a-needin' of it so! Why couldn't they have
discharged some o' them women as sets all day on
them velvet carpets an' cheers, a-doin' nothin' but
readin' story-papers? Phenie's seen 'em a-doin' of
it, time an' ag'in&mdash;an' she a-workin' at a old greasy
machine!"</p>

<p>In vain I endeavored to prove that no injustice
had been done. Mrs. Angel's attitude toward the
United States Government remains, to this day,
inflexibly hostile.</p>

<p>"Ef Columbus had let alone interferin' between
Phenie an' them that was intendin' well by her, I
reckon she'd 'a' been settin' on one o' them velvet
cheers herself by this time," she remarked, mysteriously,
"or a-doin' better still."</p>

<p>I looked at her sharply.</p>

<p>"They's a gentleman," she went on, with a foolish
smile, "a gineral, as is all taken up with Phenie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
He's a great friend o' the President's, you know,
an' they's no knowin' what he <i>might</i> do for the
gal, ef Columbus'd let alone interferin'."</p>

<p>"Then Phenie has told you of her new acquaintance?"
I said, much relieved.</p>

<p>Mrs. Angel looked at me blankly.</p>

<p>"Lord, no!" she answered, "<i>she</i> never let on!
No, indeed! But I knowed it&mdash;I knowed it all
along. Sam Weaver's gal, <i>she</i> told me about it. I
knowed she was keepin' company with him, kind
o'."</p>

<p>"And you said nothing to Phenie?"</p>

<p>"Lord, no! Gals is bashful, Mis' Lawrence.
No, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Nor say a word of all this to Columbus?" I
asked again.</p>

<p>"What fur?" said Mrs. Angel, imperturbably.</p>

<p>He ain't got no call ter interfere, ef she kin do
better."</p>

<p>I was silent a moment in sheer despair.</p>

<p>"Do you imagine, for one moment," I said,
finally, "that if this general, as he calls himself, is
really what he pretends to be, a gentleman and a
friend of the President's, that he means honestly
by Phenie?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Angel regarded me with a fixed stare, in
which I discerned wonder at my incredulity, and
indignation at the implied disparagement of her
daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked, with some heat.
"Phenie was a-readin' me a story, not so long ago,
about a man, a lord or somethin' like, as married
a miller's daughter. The name was 'The Secrit
Marriage,' or thereabouts. I'd like to know ef she
ain't as good as a <i>miller's</i> daughter, any time o'
day?"</p>

<p>I said no more. "Against stupidity even the
gods strive in vain."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A month later, perhaps, Mrs. Angel, whom I had
not seen since the interview just related, came toiling
up the stairs with her arms piled high with suggestive-looking
packages, and beamingly and unceremoniously
entered my sitting-room. With
rather more than her customary ease of manner,
she deposited herself and parcels upon the lounge,
and exclaimed, pantingly:</p>

<p>"Wall! Phenie an' Columbus is goin' ter be
married Sunday week!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" I responded, with a sympathetic thrill,
"so they have made it up again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" she answered, "they've done
made it up. They <i>was</i> one time I was most afeard
Columbus was goin' to back out, though. 'Twas
after that time when he come down here after
Phenie, an' found her a-goin' out 'long o' that
Bureau gal an' that man as called hisself a gineral!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"So you found out the character of Phenie's
friend at last?" I said.</p>

<p>"Columbus, <i>he</i> found it out. I'll tell ye how
'twas. Ye see, him an' Phenie was a-havin' of it
that night after they got home. They was in the
front room, but they's right smart of a crack 'roun'
the do', an' you kin hear right smart ef you sets up
clos't enough," she explained, naïvely.</p>

<p>"'Phenie,' says Columbus, kind o' humble like,
'I don't want no wife as don't like me better 'n ary
other man in the world. Ef you likes that man,
an' he's a good man, an' means right by ye, I ain't
one ter stan' in your way; but,' says he, 'I don't
believe he's no good. I've seen them kind befo',
an' I don't have no confidence into him.'</p>

<p>"'Columbus,' says Phenie, kind o' spirited, fur
<i>her</i>, 'you ain't got no call to talk agin' him. He's
a gentleman, he is!'</p>

<p>"'All right!' says Columbus, chokin' up, 'all
right. Mebbe he is&mdash;but I don't like this meetin'
of him unbeknownst, Phenie. It ain't the thing.
Now I want you ter promise me not to meet him
any more <i>unbeknownst</i> till you knows more about
him, an' you give me leave ter find out all about
him, an' see ef I don't.'</p>

<p>"'I won't listen to no lies,' says Phenie, kind o'
fiery.</p>

<p>"'I won't tell ye no lies, Phenie,' he says. 'I
never has, an' I ain't goin' ter begin now.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then he got up an' shoved his cheer back, and
I had ter go 'way from the crack.</p>

<p>"Wall, Phenie looked real white an' sick after
that, an' I felt right down sorry fur the gal, but I
didn't let on I knew anything, 'cause 'twaren't <i>my</i>
place ter speak <i>fust</i>, ye know! Wall, she dragged
'round fur three, four days,&mdash;that was after she
was discharged, you see,&mdash;an' one evenin' Columbus
he come in all tremblin' an' stirred up, an' him
an' her went inter the room, an' I sat up ter the
crack. An' Columbus he begun.</p>

<p>"'Phenie,' says he, his voice all hoarse an'
shaky, 'Phenie, what would you say ef I was ter
tell ye your fine gineral <i>wasn't</i> no gineral, an' was
a married man at that?'</p>

<p>"'Prove it!' says Phenie.</p>

<p>"I had ter laugh ter hear her speak up so peart,
like. I didn't think 'twas in her, and she not
much more'n a child.</p>

<p>"'Wall,' says Columbus, 'ef <i>I</i> can't prove it, I
knows them as kin.'</p>

<p>"'Wall,' says Phenie, 'when he tells me so hisself,
I'll believe it, an' not befo'!'</p>

<p>"Then Columbus went away, an' I could see he
was all worked up an' mad. His face was white
as cotton. Phenie, she went to bed, an' I heerd
her a-cryin' an' a-snubbin' all night. She couldn't
eat no breakfast, nuther, though I made griddle-cakes,
extry for her; an' she dressed herself an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
went off somewheres&mdash;I didn't ask her, but I
reckon she went down ter the city ter find out
about that man. Wall, towards night she come
home, an' I never see a gal look so&mdash;kind o' wild,
like, an' her eyes a-shinin' an' her cheeks as red as
pinies. She sot an' looked out o' the winder, an'
looked, an' bimeby Columbus he come in, an' they
went into the room. I couldn't hear rightly what
they said, the chill'en was makin' sich a noise, but
I heared Phenie bust out a-cryin' fit to break her
heart, an' then Columbus, he&mdash;wall, Lord! I
never did see sich a feller! He jess loves the
groun' that gal's feet walks on!"</p>

<p>"He must be very forgiving," I said. "Phenie
has used him badly."</p>

<p>"Wall, I do' know," she replied, with perfect
simplicity. "I do' know as she was beholden to
Columbus ef she could a-done better. The child
didn't mean no harm."</p>

<p>Although aware of the impracticability of trying
to render Mrs. Angel's comprehension of maternal
duty clearer, I could not help saying:</p>

<p>"But why didn't you, as the girl's own mother
and nearest friend, have a talk with Phenie in the
beginning? You might have spared her a great
deal of trouble."</p>

<p>Mrs. Angel's eyes dilated with surprise.</p>

<p>"Lord! Mis' Lawrence!" she exclaimed, "you
do' know! Why, gals is that bashful! They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
couldn't tell their <i>mothers</i> sich things. Why, I'd
'a' died 'fore I'd 'a' told mine anything about&mdash;love-matters!
Lord!"</p>

<p>"Well," I sighed, "I'm glad Phenie is going to
marry so good a fellow as Columbus."</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;yes," she answered, condescendingly, "he's
a good feller, Columbus is. He don't drink or
smoke, an' he's mighty savin'."</p>

<p>I remarked here, as on other occasions, that
Mrs. Angel regarded this being "savin'" as a
purely masculine virtue.</p>

<p>"He's give Phenie most a hundred dollars
a'ready," she continued, complacently. "They
ain't no gal 'round as 'll have nicer things 'n Phenie."</p>

<p>A fortnight later the newly wedded pair called
upon me. Phenie looked very sweet in her bridal
finery, but there was something in her face which
I did not like. It meant neither peace nor happiness.
She looked older. There were some hard
lines around her lips, and the childish expression
of her lovely eyes had given place to a restless, absent
look. Her husband was serenely unconscious
of anything wanting&mdash;unconscious, indeed, of everything
but his absolute bliss, and his new shiny hat.
He wore a lavender necktie, now, and gloves of
the same shade, which were painfully tight, and,
with the hat, would have made life a burden to any
but the bridegroom of a week's standing. Phenie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
had little to say, but Columbus was jubilantly loquacious.</p>

<p>"I've gone out o' butcherin' fur good an' all,"
he declared, emphatically. "Phenie didn't like it,
an' no more do I. Hucksterin' is more to my
mind, ma'am. It's <i>cleaner</i> an'&mdash;an' more genteel,
ma'am. I've got a <i>good</i> stan', an' I mean to keep
Phenie like a <i>lady</i>, ma'am!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She lived but a year after this. She and her
baby were buried in one grave. That was five
years ago. Columbus still wears a very wide hat-band
of crape, and mourns her sincerely.</p>

<p>Her death was a heavy blow to her mother,
whose grief is borne with constant repining and
unreasoning reflections. The fountains of her eyes
overflow at the mere utterance of the girl's name.</p>

<p>"The doctors 'lowed 'twas consumption as ailed
her," she often repeats, "but I ain't never got red
o' thinkin' 'twas trouble as killed her. I used ter
think, Mis' Lawrence," she says, with lowered
voice, "that she hadn't never got over thinkin' of
that man as fooled her so! I wish I could see him
oncet! Says she ter me, time an' agin', 'Ma,'
says she, 'I reckon I ain't a-goin' ter live long.
I'm right young ter die, but I do' know as I keer!'
says she."</p>

<p>"Did her husband ever suspect that she was unhappy?"
I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lord no, ma'am! Or ef he did he never let
on! An' I never seen sich a man! There wasn't
<i>nothin'</i> he didn't git her while she was sick, an' her
coffin was a sight! An' he goes to her grave, rain
or shine, as reg'lar as Sunday comes."</p>

<p>As I have said, several years have passed since
Phenie's death, but Mrs. Angel's visits have never
ceased. The lapse of time has left hardly any
traces upon her comely exterior. In times of
plenty, her soul expands gleefully and the brown-paper
parcels multiply. In times of dearth, she
sits, an elderly Niobe, and weeps out her woes
upon my hearth-stone. The black satchel, too, by
some occult power, has resisted the wear and tear
of years and exposure to the elements, and continues
to swallow up my substance insatiably as of
yore. Occasionally, as I have said, something
within me rises in arms against her quiet, yet persistent
encroachments, but this is a transitory
mood. Her next visit puts my resolutions to
flight.</p>
